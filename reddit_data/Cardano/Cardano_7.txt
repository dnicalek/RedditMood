ELI5: Rosen Bridge/Ergo and its connection to CardanoWould love for one of the big brains to put it in simple words why this is such great news for Cardano.

I‚Äôve always heard of Ergos connection to Cardano but I don‚Äôt really understand what it is.

Also why is this bridge safe? For me personally I send coins to CEX to bridge but I‚Äôd eventually like to be able to trust a bridge. Is this *the one* or just more progress toward a safe bridge?

Edit: Happy New Year Cardano fam!* ‚ö†Ô∏è [**PSA - SCAMS**](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/lccorg/psa_there_is_no_such_thing_as_cardano_giveaways/) *Beware of scammers in direct messages.*

Rosen is great technology. They've taken a radically different approach to bridging, utilizing the security of Ergo as the base layer. It minimizes the need for smart contracts, and reduces the attack vector.

In the end it's still a bridge though. If you need a bridge, then it's a great option. If however you just need to move tokens from Cardano to another blockchain, then using a bridgeless solution like Mynth or the upcoming Maya may be more suitable for you. With Mynth for example you can send tokens from Cardano directly to a CEX.
> With Mynth for example you can send tokens from Cardano directly to a CEX.

I don't get why this is a thing.
Think of Ergo as a PoW partner chain. Interoperability is good for both Ergo and Cardano ecosystems. Also if you have Cardano, you‚Äôd be doing yourself a huge favor to pick up some ERG via the Rosen Bridge. Ergo‚Äôs market cap is ridiculously low for how solid the tech is. If Ergo even becomes a top 30 coin (which it definitely should be)  even a small investment will payoff big time.
Ergo's relationship with Cardano is more like a partner blockchain that uses POW, in that they share lots of tech with each other. Both use the eUTXO model, and many of the papers coming out of Cardano have been used in Ergo and vice versa. For example, the protocol describing the DJED stablecoin was implemented first in Ergo as SigUSD.

The partnership is mainly because they share the same roots and philosophy. The founder of Ergo (Alex Chepurnoy) used to work at IOHK. Ergo adviser Dan Friedman is still affiliated with IOG as well, and Charles himself has always been supportive of Ergo. Most of the Ergo community (myself included) came through Cardano as well.

Only time will truly tell if Rosen Bridge is safe. Even the team has said that. But it is open-source (anyone can check the code), more decentralized with guards and watchers (harder to attack), and uses other features like multi-sig cold wallets so in theory only a fraction of the funds is at risk (less incentive to hack).

If you have the time do check out the Ergo ecosystem. It's nowhere near as big or flashy as Cardano due to its community-drive nature, but honestly the tech is pretty cool. Feels very cyberpunk and what cryptocurrency should be.

This is the one.
Can you elaborate more?
Ah, unless I misunderstood somehow, you can send tokens to a CEX now, why do you need a third party involved?    
Unless by tokens you mean NFT's or something that you can't normally send?
Most CEXs only support ADA, they don't support Cardano native assets. If you want to send ADA to a CEX, sure, you don't need to do anything else. Many people don't want to store funds in a volatile asset however, they prefer to use stablecoins. If you want to send a Cardano stablecoin to a CEX, then you can use Mynth. Otherwise you've got to swap for ADA and be exposed to volatility.

Edit to add: Also since we're in the context of bridging, if you want to send BTC from Cardano to a CEX, you wouldn't be able to do that directly; you'd need a service like Mynth otherwise you'll have to interact with both Cardano wallet and Bitcoin wallet.

that's alot of plans
It's great to see the progress in 2023 and plans for 2024, wishing you the best of luck in achieving them.


However, what really bugged me about the article was the way it read,was it written through Chat GPT?
I just can‚Äôt take this name seriously. Sprectrum is a universally hated brand in the US
Portfolio Tracker on Cardano?I know we have TapTools which is amazing. But is there a portfolio tracker I can use on Android or iOS that's safe to use? I just want to have alerts that keep me up to date.* ‚ö†Ô∏è [**PSA - SCAMS**](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/lccorg/psa_there_is_no_such_thing_as_cardano_giveaways/) *Beware of scammers in direct messages.*

I use [https://cointracking.info/](https://cointracking.info/) it works on iOS and android. Plus it does taxes.
As you said, TapTools has a portfolio tracker and is amazing, but they don't have an app yet (they said that is in their 2024 goals).

The only other solution I know is [Poki](https://www.getpoki.com/), but unfortunately, it has some basic uses for its free version, while you can unlock the "Pro" version if you purchase their [NFT](https://www.jpg.store/collection/poki-lifetime-pass?tab=items) from the JPG store (its value is high -over 500 ADA). It has a web version, but also an Android and iOS app.

Personally, I am a happy "Pro" version user, but I understand that is a big investment for someone to make.

This is the only (other than Tap Tools) app that I know that can track all your Cardano Native Tokens and NFTs. Of course, there are dozens, not Cardano-specific, apps that you can add and see all your Crypto portfolio, but they likely will not recognize the value of Cardano NFTs (if you hold any).

I hope you find a solution to your needs. Have a Happy New Year my friend!
I'm using Coinstats, there's support for the main ADA wallets. It also sends price update notifications
Check Coinstats. Helps me to track ADA from all the wallets and exchanges.
