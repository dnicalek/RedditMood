I don't think a single person in the world likes play to earn models.
Notable memes on cardano?Are there any notable memecoins on cardano? Im making an educational video on cardano and ADA and wanted to use a dog or cat coin for examples so I don‚Äôt lead people on to buying another coin. 
I have asked in ada_memes but wanted to ask here as well because traffic seems low there

SNEK is Cardano's most popular meme at the moment.
Thank you. I was planning on doing a few examples. What would you say are the three most recognized memes ? Appreciate ur help.
It kind of is the only real full meme coin there
Snek
Understood, thank you. If you had to say which are the top three? Hoping to use more than one for examples.
Hi!

Snek is the most prominent one, in terms of community and Market Cap. It is the 2nd biggest Native Asset on Cardano, and 1st if you count tokens that are only native to Cardano's blockchain (it has a Market Cap of over 100 million USD).

Also, the OG Memecoin is Hosky. It is highly respected inside Cardano's community, because it didn't try to persuade people to buy it for gains, so it isn't a pump-and-dump scheme, and doesn't have ponzinomics. With various actions (NFTs with low minting price, Stake Pools that give Hosky, Books for Book. io, etc.) his founder tries to bring value and education to people. So, he really tries to push adoption for Cardano, not just his memecoin, and this is the reason we all love him.

Now, there isn't a 3rd big option here. From the last Meme coin cycle, half a year ago, the one that kinda survived is $BANK, while right now you can find a lot of (mostly pump-and-dump) meme coins that have big gains, and then kinda faint away. $FREYA (named after Charles Hoskinson's dog), and $FREN had some big gains the last couple of days, but they will probably fade away as the memecoin-mania passes (you will never know though). 

Now, you said that you want to educate people about Cardano's meme coins. If you are going to make an educational video about them, please be careful. You have a responsibility towards your viewers. Yes, they can buy whatever they want in the end, but some of them might follow your advice. Meme coins are highly speculative investments, and most of them will go eventually to zero. 

Big meme coins like SNEK and HOSKY, (probably) won't go away, because they have big communities behind them, and founders who are trying to bring value not only to their coins, but (most importantly) Cardano itself. Also, because they are quite big in terms of marketcap, the possibility of high returns is not big. So, don't expect riches from them.

But, all the others are pure gambling. If someone wants to toss some ADA to a "CharlesWhaleVoldemortInu" coin, like they buy a lottery ticket, of course, it is their choice. But, they should always understand that is nothing more than that. Gambling. Not investment, not a "way to be rich" scheme.

Please, don't let your followers believe something else. It is pure decency to not deceive them, in a way that they will think that they are going to be rich by buying an animal-themed shitcoin.

To conclude, meme coins can be fun, create beautiful relationships through their community, and make some people (the initial ones) rich. But, because Crypto is also a financial instrument, and (not always but most of the times) is a zero-sum game, the enrichment of one person, can be the economic devastation of another. When money gets in the way, things can be toxic and ugly, especially when people invest in them more than what they are afraid to lose.

So, treat them with the understanding of what they are, the pros and their cons, and try to really educate your followers not only of the potential uprise, but the (most probably) demise of any meme coin.

I hope you are going to make a nice and educational video. Good luck!
What‚Äôs the contract address for CharlesWhaleVoldamortInu
Snek , hosky , bank
Clay nation has a lot of memes/ meme-able things. A lot of it stays in the community. The Clay eyes is a great example. 

Edit: obviously Snek is the meme king of cardano. The Hosky token twitter account often drops some bangers as well
$SNEK $HOSKY are the main two. 

Then there are $BANK $DGAF $FREN $PICKLE
SNEK
SNEK üêç
$SNEK is the real memecoin honestly, the one that have other things besides being just a memecoin
sssup

SNEK is huge in Cardano. One of the loudest meme communities on twitter and discord always crazy hyped
Hosky is the original. 420k NFTs, 96k wallets, the health of the ecosystem is priority.

When talking about memecoins I always look for the one that brings the least amount and value. 

It can only be Hosky
SNEK, BULL, FREYA.
$SNEK will hit 1 Billion trading volume in about 24 hours the first Cardano native token ever to do so.  I can tap you in with the community if you would like more details and I‚Äôm also happy to help I have a decent understanding of the token and what they have done.
$SNEK #1 by far 
$Hosky OG meme solid #2 
$Fren New and hyped seems to have staying power so it gets #3 from me
1.) SNEK
2.) HOSKY
3.) FREYA
Reddit is so behind the curve. FREN is red hot right now.
