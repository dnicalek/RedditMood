Quarter mil to uncle Sam!

Inspiring, what’s your sale amount? Or will you be a long term holder?
This is some deep fking value.
Ok we got it.
Bnb will this reach $600?
Having half a million in doge on Robinhood is wild lol beyond props
I hope so, gonna donate half of the profits.
I Yolo’d all my eth into doge last weekI was wondering why the price went up 2 cents
Honestly, a 50/50 would have been my play. I respect the Yolo though.
Why?
because eth fees are high and dogecoin is literally on the moon feb 23rd :)
I gave up staking rewards it was a tough decision
50 Cent - Get Rich or Try Dyin’

Died trying
Bottle full of 'bub.

Good luck.  I am all in too
Me too but about a year ago
Me too but at 50 cents
Better investment than Ethereum
U sir deserve some form of a plaque.
I have traded ETH and a couple others to add to my Ðoge collection many times. Stocks too. I’m almost completely in Ðoge now because I’m ready for liftoff.  ❤️🐕
just wait till doge hits $10 and you’re a millionaire 😎
❤️

Pow pow!!
Is it good to stake.????
Yes or no?
Be careful you can’t get your money out so fast once you stake

Ouch. Not a smart move.
it was smart
But ETH is up like 10% today 😭
Wrong move you should wait till everything shot up then at the last only move to doge.
Bro..............  ..................
even my mom has more doge
RIP
moon in Feb? How? Wdym?
Doge-1 my guy.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doge-1
High fees on eth are kinda good for price though...
it’s definitely smarter at least short term
ETH just broke like 2450 lol
Where were you staking?  And aren't you worried about something happening to the exchange and losing all of your coins?
WAIT i lied!!  I still have 50 bucks of eth across 10 wallets i cant move so technically not all my eth is gone lmfao what a scam.
ty
peregrine lander taking literal dogecoin to moon landing feb 23rd
This is the most outlandish crypto project I know of by far now. This’ll either really benefit doge or absolutely crash it depending on how it goes. There’s no in-between
Imagine if Doge-1 satellite discovers life out there…
not doge 1, that is just a satellite
Doge-1 is mostly likely delayed and won’t be on IM1 in Jan
How many of you with HODL think Doge will reach the ATH of $.75?$1+
I raise you $2
1$ or bust
I think $10 in 2024 because doge will finance Sattelite Doge-1Mission and the first advertisement that will be televised from space will be Doge
I just need it to get to .27 to see green again, yes, I was one of those people. lol jumped in late expecting great things in 2021.
lol, cries in .41
0.62
It’s still a good time to drop av down
Not if you just go all in now. Will lower your average cost!
Keep averaging in, and then when you are sick of the rat race, start averaging out, and once you've averaged out enough so that you feel comfortable, retire early.
I’m at .32 so your doing that much better then me. Looking for that $1.00 and then more! To the moon!
$8 Doge
I'm honestly just gonna hold until I retire
1 dollar in 2024
Blow right past that on the way to the moon!
1Ð=1Ð
This is the best answer
I will be happy with .50 or .60
doge millionaire guy wasnt.
1 billion dollar doge.. ONE DAY

![gif](giphy|DfbpTbQ9TvSX6)
![gif](giphy|mPOGx4hJtOWSA)
2$ next year
![gif](giphy|StvAKMwlBxPbZr3nSP|downsized)

Gonna blow past .75🚀
$42.00 by 2025!!
Actually be serious dude










It'll easily be $83.47

In time yes but, it might be a long time. I’ve been HODL’ing 14k coins since they were 0.005585 each. I’ve seen my account as high as $10500 usd so why sell now. It’s been one fun roller coaster ride.

Edit edited amount to match coin total for math Karen. I did sell some but I don’t remember the exact amount.
How can 14k coins make your account worth $15k? Doge has never been even $1
A person who thinks all the time has nothing to think about except thoughts...
Just think of it this way.. it’s never *not* reached new all time highs
Let’s be real if doge ever hits 1, it’ll go past that.
I just canceled $1 in my head $5+
Imma sell just 20% and hold the rest, I have 100k doge
What number is the moon?
I doubt it very much, but I will HODL until I really need the money.
No doubt!
yeah it will definitely
I'd be surprised of DOGE breaks .20 again.
.30 cent 2025
$4.2069
$3 in 2027
I don't know if it will ever get to 20 cents again, quite frankly. Be nice if it did
It will be interesting to see.  Let's hope for the best.  I mined it back in 2013 for a few years so I'm excited to see how this pays out in the long run.  I have so many different crypto, anyone ever here of FTH Feathercoin? I have a ton of that too lol
$1 next
If it doesn’t reach .50 in 2024 I might pull my play money
I like to think so, but it seems unrealistic
Realistically I don’t see it hitting much more than a dollar and then plummeting. I think if it gets hot like before, it might make a run but the 2021 crypto run was an anomaly alongside stocks. Something new will come along to run better.
I could see it hitting over $1 at some point. We just need another Karen Baskin scenario 😉
Every holder I know has claimed they will sell before then (they all say $.25 or $.50 but I doubt it).

I’m just gonna HODL it cause I like the coin lol.
✋🏽
Harborjeebee
I mean that’s almost when I bought in soooo… Count me in!
Bought my big bag at .002 so whatever
Much wow
nope
I didn’t sell at 68¢ why would I sell it before it hits $10
In the world of investing the best opinion is no one knows. Its all hopium... unless you're a politician
Y'all don't know what HODL means! Who cares how high it goes?? I ain't selling!! DIAMOND HANDS, BABY!!
Honestly, I don't see it rising that high. We couldn't even maintain above 10 cents recently. I hope I'm wrong
Never going to happen
Not going to happen if new DOGE keeps getting created. The inflation is horrid
Is there any new development on Doge to warrant more demand/higher prices?
Doge is one of the few that I think will likely keep making new highs with each bull run.
I'm not going to tell you these coins will increase in value, or even hold their current value. The truth is, you bought 'em because you like 'em. They have value to you. That's what matters.
Sadly world economy will crumble before any of that happens… so about 3-5 years
1 doge =1 doge
It will eventually. That's what the stats show
I hold DOGE and i believe DOGE will hit $1 in this bull market season.
it's going to 4.20$ high next
It's just a when, not an if, and the answer may be >1year, wouldn't sell then anyway
$1
True HODL-ers wait till the moon 😎
I don’t think so, IRS
What’s an exit strategy?
0001%
all of us.
Last bull run was it's peak.
I've locked mine in a wallet that can only be opened in 50 years time
It’s safe bro. Relax.
We are easily going to reach $0.75 and go beyond that, maybe to $10.
But isn't the doge mission already paid for? It will definitely help bolster doge when it happens but I'm not sure about $10, maybe upwards of $2?

I am hopeful though, to the mooooon!
It does not really matter whether it is $2 or $10 as long it goes up so that we can profit. We should just go on buying at this low price
Ok isn’t $10 like a $1 trillion+ market cap though?  😂 I like where yoir heads at though, I raise to $100.
It is but if bitcoin already had 1 trillion in market cap and headed back to 1 trillion again there should be another trillion dollar coin and why not let it be Doge
You should stop consuming substances. Only you can save us from you.
C O M M I T
He still hodls four million doge and only needs doge to reach $0.25 to be a millionaire again. It won't be long.
Let's be realistic. I don't see it above $10 at 2025, but it still a ton of money even if yo buy now
I think $1.40 is top for 2025. My guess though only time will tell I was trolling.
r/theydidthemath
He's hodl 14k now. Probably sold a few k
Exactly. And doge is faster and more secure than bitcoin, so there is no reason why doge's market cap won't match and exceed that of bitcoin.
