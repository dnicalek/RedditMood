Yes ….. yes you did!!
That's a lambo when it hits $300,000 a doge.

There is a dippier dip to buy now.

I feel like this whole subreddit is trolling, and we all know that'll never hit more than 1$ 😂

I was asked to post a better example of Scrypt MiningThese are Bitman L7 9050 about 3250 watts each (11 working in picture). These are Scrypt algorithm miners that produce DOGE and LTC simultaneously.. the amount varies daily but recently can produce 1850-2000 DOGE per day That’s a lot of power, how much is the electric bill ?
Last month about 3400.00
Small start up price of $54,999
Yes that’s about what the 11 miners would cost currently as they have come down substantially in price due to the amount that have been produced since the first units started hitting the market in January of 2022. This rig use to produce 3500 doge a day but with more miners on the chain the difficulty goes up and the yield drops.. I paid anywhere from 23000 to as little as 4500 depending on when they were bought. I have two out (12-13) getting worked on. I’m hoping I can get one unit between the two of them. The BEST thing to do to avoid having to set up and potentially having to upgrade your residential power from 200 amps to 400 amps is to have the units hosted. I spent almost 20k to upgrade the main line and box to get 400 amps. The electrician couldn’t get the approved meter can, as there were 6-8 months wait during Covid. Fortunately he found one in Alabama and drove to get it from a family friend that owned a company that did big electrical jobs and had 2 on hand
How much did you pay for the stainless manifolds?
It was originally one long one but had cut and capped off .. 10,000 for both
I have a few l3+ some for parts of you're interested. Sorry for asking so abruptly. Nice setup BTW!
In the picture there are 14 L3++ sitting dormant and 2 Bitmain E9’s … I originally started with 23 L3++ in May of 2021. They cost me 46,000 then .. now I think they go for about 100.00 each on EBAY so it’s not worth the time to mess with.
I will have to pass . Thanks
Lol .. of the 7 people I personally know who got into mining in 2021 only 2 survived.. I’m one of them. My one friend got wrecked for 400,000 buying the wrong miners at the wrong time. I myself have probably made 120,000 ish in profits but have inadvertently suffered 110,000 in mistakes (learning lessons)..it’s definitely not for everyone
I can feel the heat through my screen
Yes they kick out 73-90 Celsius before shutting off. The exhaust does a good job but in July and August when it was 103-109 had units shutting down when the hit 90 Celsius
Could you explain how mining doge or know some guide from begginner?
Let me rent one!
Oof!!!
But currently while on the lower end of the spectrum bring in about 6000 per month and about 200 of the bill is for my residential use
Anything special inside of them? Thats not even a 1k of material..
It was hard even finding someone to make it. I was quoted 17,000 from another company and 2 others said not interested… the guy that did it was in his mid 20’s and told me the material was about 2000 .. it was made from a big single sheet of 1/4” stainless steel ..,the pipe on the sides are 4” and the exhaust port on the end is 8” flared to 16”.. said it took 80 hours to weld.. the prototype was made with clay and fat plastic straws cut to show where to put the pipe outlets .. the guy said it was challenging to build
If there is nothing special on the inside some design choices can be changed and the amount of time and materials can be reduced.
I hold doge because it’s funnyAnd it would be funny if we went from dead presidents to funny yellow dogYeah, I do enjoy seeing how ticked off "real investors" get when their portfolio of heavily researched stocks are down 30% and I'm over here making 100's on some silly dog crypto  that I bought on a whim...
Makes me lol every time
As long as you....

Bought money to make money. Which money is the real funny money.
I made over 20k on Doge and still hold over 10k in shares because I spent little to nothing on it. It’s GREAT!
Wish I could say the same but I’m just hodling until the world catches up

It'll be hilarious when you get more rich by doing so
 funny meme dog go up up!
Wow, your awesome 😎
I know
You laugh but Robinhood was doing shares for doge. Not sure if they’ve changed it by now but they were definitely pulling one over on new investors.
I like shares. Sharing is caring.
