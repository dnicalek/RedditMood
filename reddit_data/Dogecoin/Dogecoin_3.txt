Read. Doge 2025 .30 so good call. 

Also you should take some profits‚Ä¶ even if I didn‚Äôt say sell. 

Also wth is wrong with you that makes you think throwing the above 1 dollar number for doge makes sense? 

Where did you read that or find that information? I can show you where I found my information that predicts .30 by 2025. Love to see your magic 1 dollar shill info. 

As I wrote this I realized you‚Äôre the worst type of doge on this team. Keep it real. For real, real. Not a fantasy.
Your unfaithful to doge, your the worst type of person on this sub lol look at you tryna belittle me when the evidence is there. Why did it hit .74 and don't say you knew it would hit .74 when it was at .003 because you and every website didn't know. Just like now their predictions. I believe it'll hit a new ATH over $1 wether you do or not quit belittling people and do research. All it takes is 1 good bull run for us to hit $1.20 lol. Go do research, your obviously uneducated.

I have always been a fan of high doge price. But that‚Äôs some straight shill.
Hodled through the worst of timesI admittedly was later in the game but when doge hit 70 cents I could have cashed out and had a years salary in savings. I put my life savings into it. But I didn‚Äôt take any out. Since then I‚Äôve been subject to layoffs twice, I blew whatever was left in my savings account that I‚Äôd managed to save back up on rent and taking care of my mom, she got sick last year and passed away recently. I am jobless again and cashed out a 401k to try and hold me over for now. Not a post to be a downer, just here to say I am overjoyed at the charts recently and I have so much confidence doge will be off on the next bull run next year. Hodl no matter what. Doge handsCan‚Äôt loose if you don‚Äôt sell, Moon Shibe! Moon!!
Dogecoin price could reclaim above $0.1 as DOGE community prepares for Astrobotic Moon Missionit's not even happening tomorrow. Who knows when it'll actually happen.
This launch was pushed back along with the Doge-1 launch. Its all a joke. If it happens, it happens... until then, I'm not holding my breath.
