Love to see Doge getting real world use 📈I firmly believe dogecoin are not made to make money but to be money instead. 1 doge=1 doge indeed.
right, dogecoin was first started as a way to make fun of people who bought crypto as an "investment".  

How funny would it be if dogecoin actually become the world first cryptocurrency with actual real world application, rather than being just a vehicle for speculative gambling.

Won't lie to you, I got in for the "investment" but studying the coin with time I realized this could be the everlasting cheap coin for everyone to use, something that could break the system for good. It would be hilarious. I even dumped my coins to dogecoin core, and paper wallet, so I can't see the price.
Just bought another 1,000 dollars worth of dogeTo the moon and still holding at .23 cents but every little bit counts. Here’s to 2024 $1.00 and beyond! Here’s to all the holders still in it to win it. Happy New Year’s to all!If the price goes down in the US does it go up in Australia?
It's not based on what the us dollar is worth, so it wouldn't go up in Aus
I buy weekly.  It’s good to keep buying.
Woot woof!!

Moon soon 🌝 

💎💎💎🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🚀🚀🚀
Let’s go to $1!
You are truly a gent among gents.
I bought another million worth of
I've been out of the loop for a while but lately I've seen some other posts where people are thinking it might go to $1 in 2024. Is this pure hopium or is there something on the horizon that I'm missing?
100k btc

$1 doge

1k xmr

Three greatest coins
Yes, it’s pure hope. This sub will have you thinking it’s fr happening though.

My advice (not a financial advisor) if you have coins, just hold them. Buy on dips and if it goes up, it goes up. If it doesn’t go up, that’s what’s expected and realistic.
Save some for the rest of us!
Great job...
Woah! Here's to the moon and beyond in 2024!
This is the way
Moon
Should've just thrown it in hut8

Doge is literally going to the moon.

? Well it looks like you're using some weird logic, I was more thinking because Australia is upside down. Check your logic bro it ain't sound.
I bought 16k coins for $24 way back in the day. Failed to sell at the ATH, so still holding
Damn bro, I just put in $150 a couple weeks ago and only got 1.6k coins.

I wish I got in that early. I’d have around $75k.
That’s why I keep buying.  I just find it hard to believe that doge will disappear .  I just have a feeling it will only go up, but when we least expect it. Now is my time to buy!
I don’t think it’ll disappear, but I think the chances of it going back up anywhere near $0.75 is very unlikely. This sub very often takes it too far, which ruins the fun tbh.

That being said, I’m not selling unless it does go up that high again. It’s not impossible, just very unlikely. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Me in 2025 when asked how I knew Doge was going to the moon.… “I know nothing about finance” 🐕💎🙌Let me rephrase “LITERALLY”
