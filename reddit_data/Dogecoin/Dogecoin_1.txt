LITERAL DOGECOIN ON THE MOON LAUNCH JANUARY 8TH!!!!What happened to the Astrobotic launch on Dec 23rd?

Edit: I just looked it up. Of course its delayed, yet again
Yea it's called launching a rocket to the moon.  It isn't easy.  One thing that makes it great for the doge community is the true Hodler's are very patient.  It would also be so doge if the rocket blew up, it would be hilarious, and set us on the path of another launch increasing our awareness of the universe.  So, keep delaying and keep upping the intensity we watch this launch.  Superbowl X 10000 for doge hodlr space enthusiasts like me.
Price hits $7.84 world governments look in awe as a new parabolic Dogecoin Phase hits before crashing to $1.80.... 

If only.
Pray to jesus and hope the pope is dope and if not smoke dope to cope instead of a rope
When is the SpaceX mission for the cube sat?
not sure but I think same month- and less fun than a literal coin on the moon!
