Doge let’s go!!!
That’s crypto.

It will soar to the highest of highs, then drop to the lowest of lows, then do absolutely nothing for a stretch of time, then repeat.

Just gotta sell some coins while it’s high and buy some coins while it’s low.
its not?
Not sure, but it'll dive soon too.
BTC ETF got approved
Doge got a taste of hookers and blow and now its flying.
If you look at the 5+ year trends of Bitcoin / Ethereum and Dogecoin (and I'm sure others) you'll see they basically imitate each other. So when Bitcoin goes up, likely Doge will too. Otherwise google for specific news, but it's usually just the market.
Are you real or fake?

Do you prefer ashley, or mary kate?
To the mooooooooooooon!!!!!!!!
Only way it shoots up like that is from a whale entering the party lol
#MEME COIN SEASON!
You call this flying? I am managing expectations right now after seeing this post.
Bitcoin is up
You have a funny definition of flying. 😂
of course...I just sold the doge I had last week.   
Figures, a day late and a dollar short.
I don’t see it flying. Just spiked up 6-7%. I hope you don’t consider that flying
Every .001 cent is a new resistance level. Constant breakage.
Also, Coinbase stock and S&P are bullish, DXY is bearish = BTC up = DOGE follows
TA, like it or not
i would like to see a website that collects and shows a percentage of accurate TA predictions made by a certain person. Those rates seem unlikely to be good
The past is the past... At one point it was valued at .002-.005....

Time is on our side.
Where’s my doge fam!!!Woooooooooo! Woooooooo!We flying high tonight!
Im hereee
So are y’all j holding for a long time or selling once you’re up a profit and then reinvesting?
Im gonna hold  long and slowly buy more as I can afford it.
holy ow
Why Dogecoin is going upHi shibes.

For those wondering why we’re pumping. 

Elon musk is going. On Spaces in an hour or so to discuss a wide range of things, including crypto. Some are speculating he will talk about Dogecoin.  You’re welcome.Link to the event: https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1rmxPMwPXXQKN
He should talk to the president of Argentina about making doge the official currency of Argentina.
This news pumps Dogecoin but some people think when we launch a satelite called Doge-1 and send a real coin to the moon its not going to impact the price.. I am new as hell at this but I don't get that.
What you'll find the longer you stay here is that the "they're putting Dogecoin on the moon!" posts get posted every single week with a new scheduled launch date. In Bitcoin, it's a never-ending stream of "the next two weeks are critical." In Dogecoin, it's a never-ending stream of near-term future launch dates to allegedly put a coin on the moon. Just keep your eyes open and watch how the launch date keeps getting a little further out every time you read someone comment about it.

It's not to say that delays are a conspiracy theory or that the mission won't ever launch, but there are 100% people who comment a continuous stream of "there will be a literal Dogecoin on the moon next month" updates to people they know aren't going to do any sort of research into whether it's true or not, in hopes of trying to get people to FOMO into buying more.
Ahh I see, thank you for responding and providing that feedback.
