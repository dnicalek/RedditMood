Doge Goes UpKeeping the dream alive
Woof woof!
DOGE will dominate the market again!
YES BUY HIGH !!!   This is the way  :)
You say buy high. This is going nowhere but up. This is the new buy low.
High is the new low. Low is still low. Buy buy buy!!
Bought at 10.2, Iâ€™m your guy. Yay me
Itâ€™s down for the week and is useless
But if you averaged down 3 months ago then youâ€™d have pulled a 51% gain over that span. The market isnâ€™t decided in a week. Just needs to break resistance.
Itâ€™s been .07-.09 since this day last year. Relax.
Exactly. When you buy in on a position with any investment. It can go either up or down. No guarantees. The hype in these pages can be toxic at times. Just be happy with where you buy in, and hope for the best. If you lose on it.. it's all good too. Just don't put all your eggs in one basket.

Weird how it wonâ€™t go below 9 now. Like something is controlling it
Was just below .09 this morning
![gif](giphy|l2JebWsCnQSXYORAA)
Zoom out itâ€™s going more so sideways. It canâ€™t break out from this range
I zoomed out and itâ€™s up 51% in the past 3 months
Whatâ€™s up Doge!
What goes up must come down! Buy High Sell Low
btc went up, this is just an artifact
doge is for boys and btc is for men
![gif](giphy|TgCa6pJMbNlWjyzmZi)
Waiting for that 7c drop for a nice purchase
It dropped to 5c 3 months ago
Just wait till 2c.
Where is it nowâ€¦
Everyoneâ€™s new year resolution was to buy crypto man. Itâ€™s still low right now
Zoom out further. We should be up more but itâ€™s not
ðŸ˜‚ just about everything is down over that span. Part of the market my guy.
Gotta find those buy zones and average your position. Itâ€™s not an easy thing to be successful at
Thatâ€™s ainâ€™t gonna happen
Bitcoin and other crypto are up 150% ðŸ˜­
Bitcoin is one of probably two coins up over that span. Most altcoins are down, the couple of apex coins aside, the market has declined over that span.
As a matter of fact you could argue dogecoin has out performed many, up 33% over the past year. Sure itâ€™s been a roller coaster ride but most coins have this year.
Ethereum is up 96%. ADA is up 148% Iâ€™m hoping this year is better for doge
Me too brother, i guess my point here is that this year has provided a ton of opportunity for those investors who got in late the last run to hedge themselves into a positive or nearly positive position.
Tell me your woes shibis, I'll be your shibicologistsWhat is love?

When moon?
You are the moon, like many others.
Your post makes me woeful no more...

now Doge and Shibe such happy!

Thank you; Oh great and awesome shibicologist!
Good bot.
bots respond like me :-) No cure for that.
no more
Doge to a $1 2024I was just thinking like all shibes but my thought was. When doge goes to the $1 Im going cheers to Dogecoin for a remarkable journey its been. I appreciate the hard times Ive been through but the memes made the pain a lil bit better. So yea my thoughts or anyone else thought this. Lmkdoge 1$ tomorrow or hahaha
Eventually , its goin to be a journey first
You win it.
If i goes to $1 I'll donate to an animal shelter
I genuinely believe doge will and I feel like this is the last call to hop on the doge train
Doge hits $1 I'm selling half at the least
Thatâ€™s right , everyone learned their lesson last time. Gonna be hard to Moon with everyone bailing out as it goes up.
Better set the sell at .95...
.9624
That's more realistic than you might think.
Still regret not selling at 75$ but my 200$ I bought at 2 cents is still worth something. Still havenâ€™t sold lol
Lol I'm gone at a quarter
i think it will go to $2.00 ðŸŽˆðŸ™‚ðŸŽˆ
I agree, and honestly think it will triple that once all the 10% boys cashed out and get left behind.
Well you've got like another 5-10 years to wait for that but at least you got a good attitude lol.
Who said I was selling I was talking about drinking whiskey and giving a cheers to dogecoin for the ride
When it goes to $1 I want to help others.
Cap
180 billions are needed for doge coin to reach a dollar
Im sorry but if it can tap .75 in 2021 it could easily tap $1  in 2024, im not saying it willâ€¦..but still 1doge =1doge
Doge was already at .72, $1 is well within reach.
with 180 billions fresh usd dropped in doge it might reach the market cap of 500b 1t or even 3t nobody knows

but way you think you understand thing is not correct
*142 billion
lol most people will dump their bags as soon as it hits 0.25-0.40 cents and move on to other coins. Trust me.
â€œ tRuSt mE â€œ
Problem is you people think.. thats where the issue is.
Same ole same ole doge to a dollar same song and dance since early 2021
If it goes to $1, itâ€™s likely going a lot higher.
Wake up, 1 dollar never ever going to happen. Realistically speaking here.
At Doge's peak, it reached about 8.9% of BTC's market cap. At $100k per bitcoin, 8.9% of BTC's market cap would equate to about $1.31 per doge. I don't think the hype will exceed last run, and while $1 seems unlikely, it is, at least within the realm of possibility.
Try making a coherent post
A lot of people will jump ship. There will be a huge correction. Then we can cruise in up to about $6
Doge will definitely hit $1 this year.
Hahahhahahahahah good joke
Massive Cope
Yeah right lmao
Itâ€™s never going to happen.
why?     
Dogecoin is just a currency, it is better that it stays at its current rate because volatility is detrimental for a currency.
Idk man but Iâ€™ve been holding doge when it was just a baby in its infancy. Selling at anything less than 1$ would just seem criminal. Kinda like giving off my kid to the highest bidder doesnâ€™t sound right to me
I'll wait 30 years to sell at 4.20... idgaf
Hahhahahahahahahahahahahahahah k
Sunk cost fallacy is crazy
![gif](giphy|3ov9jPghXAsbvLmcjm)
I wish I never sold, now I'm gonna hate my life when it eventually hits a buck. I had over four hundred thousand back when it was less than a quarter cent.
Cry more
Iâ€™m not selling until $100
I think once it passes $1 it will instantly drop and the. Naturally the race to $2 but ultimately $100 at some future date
I do my best to explain something as clearly as I can and the comment I'm replying to gets deleted. Oh well, anyways, shame to let it go to waste. In case someone else needs to hear it:


I'm saying you don't need 142 billion dollars to reach a 142 billion market cap for a cryptocurrency. 

Obviously, if the market cap is 142 billion, and there are 142 billion coins, the price for 1 coin at that point is 1$. That's saying, if the market cap is x, the market cap is x. What I'm saying, if the market cap is x, we will collectively have put in significantly less than x in traditional currency, and we can get less than x out of it. There wouldn't be 142 billion dollar in worth, because when you try to get 10 billion out at that price, the next ten billion will be worth significantly less, because the market responds to those things 

The worth of a coin is significant in what you get for selling your personal bag at that point, and what it costs to expand it. It isn't indicative of the total value existing in the cryptocurrency, and it doesn't require that value to reach it. The value put in is the total value of every coin at its last transaction put together. If half of it is bought under a cent, but there is a rush to buy while most of those people hold driving it up to 1 dollar, those coins will still have less than a cent put in despite being worth more. The later buy-ins might buy in for 80 cent. Only the last few before reaching it wil pay around 1 dollar per coin. 

Market cap is basically just the latest transaction times the amount of coins. Nothing more, nothing less. It does not require 142 billion dollars to reach a market cap of 142 billion dollars.
will be 0.50 in 2024 at least
I'll make sure I get out at .99
Possible to happen! $1 is coming very soon!
Itâ€™ll be a few decades before it ever reaches $1 unless more than trillions of dogecoin gets burned in next year
I know its just doge so i say the dumbest things for fun, hence great communitery
Never mind having any credibility. I guess thatâ€™s not important to you. People like you are whatâ€™s holding doge back.
ðŸ˜‚donâ€™t hold your breath, my guy. Take that money and put it toward Real Estate.
I hope it is. We all need some euphoria with the success doge.
Lol most people will bail as soon as it goes 0.25cents
Droppin' the bag around $0.84, everyone else can fight over the scraps.
Cashing out at .83999 now
How much money would have to be invested into Doge for it to get that high mathematically speaking? Close to a billion or more at the least.
More like 11 trillion, unless there is some form of change done to Dogecoin, which I would never rule out.
No one said anything about you selling lol
Was me, I deleted the post lol.
You sound illiterate. Try working on your English before your math.
ðŸ˜‚ who knows, with all these gramar mixstaxes, i very well cudd be
Itâ€™s mathematics.
Having a certain market cap doesn't mean every dollar is actually there to support it.
you're right, just a few movers make the price, most coins don't even move ever
How do you get 142 billions?
The circulating supply of Doge is 142 billion. It needs a market cap of 142 billion to reach $1.
Thanks ðŸ˜Š 

It took me a while to come up with that one
ðŸ˜‚
I think 2 dollars is a bit of an exaggeration at this point, but who knows, once this bitcoin etf is approved we should see upwards of 30 trillion coming into the market so i wonâ€™t say it isnâ€™t possible
I think your math is a bit off also thereâ€™s roughly 142 billion coins in circulation so realistically you will need around 282 billion market cap to hit $2 per coin. Itâ€™s not too big of an exaggeration at that number. But i still think it will take more than a year for all that money to flow into the market, it wonâ€™t be instant
No, it needs people who want to buy at $1 or above to reach that. Market cap and actual money is not a 1 to 1. If the market cap is 142 billion, you can't get 142 billion out. There isn't actually 142 billion of worth. And there doesn't need to be that much put in. Only when you reach $1 per coin do you actually need to put in one dollar a coin, before that you put in less per coin. The actual value of all coins in a cryptocurrency expressed in traditional currency is significantly lower than the market cap.
Iâ€™m sorry but thatâ€™s not entirely true. Yes market cap in stocks are different compared to crypto. 

But as it stands, if Doge had a market cap of 142 billion, it would be worth $1. All youâ€™re describing is what it takes to reach $1 but however youâ€™d like to word it, at 142 billion market cap Doge would be $1. There is no way around this unfortunately, itâ€™s simple math. Itâ€™s like denying 2+2=4
