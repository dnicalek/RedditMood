I member my first 50 dogecoins... üòõü•≥üéâüéÑüéÖ... woooooot wooootI remember when i used doge as stable coin, because it were not not doing much these days. Man i wish i would have keept it there...
Doge by the numbersThis is an update to a post I made a couple of years ago ...

For simplicity I'm using approximate numbers...

Current doge supply 145 billion 
Current subshibers here... 2.4 million.

So if we at dogecoin sub want to own all of the current supply of doge ..

145b/2.4m = 60,416.66 meaning we each would need this as a goal to hold.

Now if we this sub wanted to purchase all 5 billion new coins added annually ( fixed inflation)...

The same subshibers would have to purchase...

5B/2.4M = 2083.33 per person per year.

This is how doge will grow ... Buy and hold...

My questions to you are?

Do you hold 60,000 doge?

Did you buy at least 2083 doge this year, to absorb inflation?

Change your thinking .... Change your life.

I'm doing my part... I bought 5x inflation per person... So just this year I absorbed inflation for 5 of us.

I know in actuality we can't all hold 60,000 doge ... It's actually less, bc of the whales... So that makes it easier on us ...

As more people get interested in doge and join this sub.. the numbers needed to hold and to buy annually decrease 

Eventually the whales will sell and the people will accumulate...

At today's price approximately $.10 ... 60,000 doge will cost you $6000... That you consider savings...

With an additional $210... Added annually to eat inflation.

These numbers are easily obtainable for the average American or a developed nation.

Time and patience.I call being one the 5 peoples inflation he absorbed!
Lol .. glad I can do my part.
Wow post! Love it.
Thank you...

Keep doing your part.
I believe your idea is valid in many respects.  But I have to add that healthy markets are made up of all sorts of participants:  speculators, short term investors, swing traders, day traders, long term investors, currency purists, and yes hodlers too.

The long term success of dogecoin is through it being a currency.  The currency purists are correct on this rather simple, but profound idea.  So while hodlers are hodling, they should also consider spending.  If not now, then in the future.  The sooner the better.   A "spending bag" or spending wallet , separate from cold storage, if it makes things more convenient. Not everyone wants to do this, but everyone should consider if it's right for them.

Also, we have to recognize that traders, making up an important part of the ecosystem, also have a valid view point.  They like to mention "taking profits" when appropriate. Again, not everyone wants to do this, but the idea has validity, and people should consider if their personal situation warrants seriously considering a strategy for taking profits.

And then there are those who just want to hodl forever, till some crypto in general, and dogecoin specifically, become stabilized-ish, at some point in the future.

There's room here in this sub for a lot of viewpoints.  And good shibes are happy to entertain them all.

Agreed.... Thanks for the input...my post was just a generalization.. just to show how easily obtainable the supply is...

I'll spend when doge hits $16...

Till then... Keep buying, stacking, trading, and spending...

Doge to the moon..
