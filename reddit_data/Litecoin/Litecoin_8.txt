Can someone Please Explain thisWhy does one Whale own at least 24 wallets with 300,000 LTC? Who could this be? November 30th is when they started buying loads.Countries and banks are buying it up to keep as a reserve currency. So make use of it and put them in your cold storage, while it is still possible and cheap ;)

I really dont know... But a good sign that the stock on exchanges is shrinking. Supply shortage is good for the price.
Grayscale is attempting to convert their Bitcoin Investment Trust into an ETF. If they are successful you would expect them to follow that up with an application to convert their Litecoin Investment Trust into an ETF too.
Cold storage? Saved to a off line wallet so it is not able to be hacked.
So that he can dump them on the rest of us when he needs liquidity

Haha sorry guys didn't think anyone would notice my purchases! Didn't know what to do with my pocket change.

Atleast someone big sees the value prop of LTC. You can put two and two together when Blackrock specifically names LTC as a risk to the  BTC ETF. They ain't stupid and will probably list an LTC ETF afterwards.
