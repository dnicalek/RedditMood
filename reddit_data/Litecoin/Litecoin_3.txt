Relationship between ltc and ltcnGrayscale Litecoin Trust (LTC): LTCN price has been doubled in last month approximately, but LTC on which LTCN is based is acting like a stable coin.

So why investors investing in LTCN at 2x price instead of buying main LTC at cheaper rateDemand exceeding ltcn supply, so trading at a premium.
My batch of copium says that institutions see current LTCN price as a DISCOUNT for what it is right now to gain exposure to cryptocurrency.

That would also have to mean that the gap between LTCN and LTC has to get closed at some point to the extent that people buying LTCN at the current price will be rewarded. 

We're looking at LTC price action that's pretty non-volatile. It hasn't been this stagnant since 2016 when it went 12545% from 3 dollars to its local top in 2017.
So what you're saying is that my 15 LTC could go from 1000$ to 125450$?/s
That was a sweet run ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|give_upvote)
There is demand so you can guess what will happen to litecoin..
ltcn is a scam
My question is if BTC ETF approved wouldn't an LTC ETF be next. So LTCN will drop in price to match LTC
I've been seeing that LTCN price action as well. I would suspect many older investors see LTCN as an easier way to get exposure to LTC without having to figure out the complexities of holding it themselves. Possible that individuals with tax advantaged accounts choose to hold LTCN in trust instead of LTC that would be taxed at more aggressive rates.   


There is no denying that LTC is a functional and usable coin. Seems like people agree with that  and are willing to take on some risk for the potential reward. Nice to see IMO.
It's not unheard of 

I believe the decade long consolidation does mean something in terms of volatility. In the grand scheme of things, it really won't take all that long for LTC to jump from where it is all the way to its ATH. 

People think that LTC has too many bag holders. Yeah, there are bagholders, but a lot of them left in the span of last 3 years. The cycle is going to start again but with a lot more money ready to flow in. 

I'll always remember my friend who sold BTC on a 4x profit (bought at 1 dollar and sold at $4). He thought he was a genius then, but he's bitter af working his 9-5 job, only now accumulating ETH again.
I understand. I have ETH on Kraken because I withdrew CS2 Skins, I think I'm going to hold for a while because I see no realm where LTC drops, I have been up to date with it's value for the past 1,5 years and I have to admit, it's pretty damn stable compared to the others.
Yeah, the fact that it will continue existing instead of going to 0 is a big plus for me. 

I really think the turn around is here for the coin, and LTC may just retake its rightful place next to Bitcoin
