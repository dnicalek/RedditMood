"THE RUG PULL OF THE DECADE!"... kick fuckin' rocks
I'm bullish but imo we should not expect pump after ETFs approval.

ETFs have long term effect on organic price growth, not short term. Boomers are not going to run and spend all their life savings on ETFs on 11th January, it's just not working like that. It takes time to get the money flow.

If there will be a pump, it won't be sustainable, more like pump and dump, where daily traders cash out on the top.
But wouldn't the seeding of the applicants be significant? I think Bitwise is starting with 200M
Doesn't matter, still hodl.
I want to see a 100k USD Bitcoin in 2025 after the halving. Is that too damn much to ask?
Bitcoin will hit 100k USD in December 2024.
Yes. Forget the price. Buy bitcoin. Study it. Read about it. Learn the lightning interface.
Seems like normal expectations
My opinion about the BTC price after 10th (assuming approval)

My opinion is that if the approval happens there will be a bump up to 46-48k and then a drop down to around 40-44k. I dont believe there will be a correction to the 36k range some people are hoping for. I think if you are setting limit buys down below 40k you will end very sad you missed getting in because after the correction to 40k it will then just run up after that and nobody can guess how high (above 60k?). 

Just mentioning this because I get the feeling a lot of people are hoping for a big drop and selling off some coins now but this is a heavily manipulated market and the big players would love to scoop up your bitcoin right now. 

Obviously if the approval fails then there would be a big drop in price but be careful not to miss out on this next run. 

Just my opinion. I just bought in yesterday at 41k and plan to hold now and risk the approval failing because of the immediate profit if it is approved. 

Obviously dont listen to some a rando on reddit and follow your own opinion. Just wanted to post my thiking.
Soooo‚Ä¶ is the Epstein list a distraction from the BTC ETF, or is the BTC ETF a distraction from the Epstein list.
Amidst the confusion, the SEC will approve an Epstein ETF later this week.
I don't care what anyone says, rebel moon is great.
Ok, i will give it a try‚Ä¶
Watch Scavengers Reign instead. Proper grown up cartoons :)
So when is the decision coming for the Blackrock BTC ETF?
March officially
Just thought I'd ask here rather than make a new post-

How does everything with the Blockstream Jade and the QR code? Am I correct in believing that if the QR code fell into the wrong hands that person could access your Bitcoin, but if you use a passphrase they would not be able to? If the paper with your QR code got destroyed but you still have access to your seed words (and passphrase) would you be okay?

Just trying to get my head around how this works.

Thanks!
My understanding about the blockstream seed QR:

1) yes, if it fell into the wrong hands then that person could access your bitcoin. It is your seed in QR form. 

2) the passphrase would prevent them from being able to access your bitcoin. Still not ideal for someone to have access to your seed QR. 

3) yes, if the seed QR got destroyed but you still had access to your seed words and passphrase you can recover your bitcoin in any wallet.
It‚Äôs coming

EMBRACE LESBIANISM
Guys and gals, in the long run, it really doesn't matter that much. The individual movements of bitcoin can't be timed.  In one, three or five years, the price on a single day is effectively irrelevant.  If you get it a week before or after, it will average out.
It‚Äôs the vibe
I‚Äôm trying to remember how much Elon‚Äôs 1.5 billion purchase swung the needle. But I don‚Äôt think 200m will have a great impact on the price. But I don‚Äôt know shit about fuck.
I'd imagine they would buy OTC and therefore the impact would still be there over longer term but spread out to avoid crazy price shocks.

Interesting. Spot or futures?
We all know the Epstein ETF will probably hang from a rug pull
There are deadlines for other ETFs this week, and the SEC said they don't want to be "kingmaker" and award it to one alone. So if they're going to approve any this week, blackrock will be included.
Ok I will, thanks for the reminder

Grayscale's Chief Legal Officer: "Just filling out some Forms"And that's all it takes for the degens to go all in.
Hey, speak for yourself!!!
Everyones cheering for you Craig.
Jesus Christ‚Ä¶..panic buying right now. ETF is coming forsure.
Oh shit, is he getting divorced?!?
I'm here for him brother
Might be this form: https://x.com/coinage_media/status/1742902200198721896
Would make sense. But how does that relate to the outcome of the SEC's decision?

Is that just paperwork required irrespective of SEC decision or hints at ETF approval?
üëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄ
How is this allowed? 

Even if it's not relating to the ETF, it can be seen as information affecting their company.

I feel like Elon has gotten fucked by the SEC for less
dude, this is 100% market manipulation. 

But this is what Fink and Woods have been doing for well over a month. Woods went on CNBC and said Gensler wanted to be Treasury Secretary and if the etf isn't approved it's because Gensler is doing it for political / careerist reasons. She said that like two weeks ago... imagine saying the guy who decides if you get your etf is a corrupt careerist right before he makes his decision? insane. 

If this etf doesn't go through, there are so many people who the market will never listen to again. Including BlackRock, Cathie Woods, Saylor, etc. 

This will have been the ultimate pump and dump; and really people should go to jail for market manipulation, but they won't.
Bro just cuz youre filling forms out doesn't mean it relates to your company. You could be doing it for any reason, personally as well. üòÇ
This is interesting, the chief legal officer of an issuing firm leaking news‚Ä¶üßê

Might be the final step, or might be done anyway if approved or not. Not sure

Trader bets $379,000 at 80% odds that Bitcoin ETF will be approved by Jan 15Lol holy fuck. Someone cross post this to 
r/wallstreetbets
That‚Äôs what sub I thought this was coming from lol
Here instead: https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetBetsCrypto/
The irony of laying 6 figures on a bet when you can just BUY 379K worth of BTC.
That might be pocket change for him, tho.
Who‚Äôs to say he doesn‚Äôt already have much more in actual BTC but he (an insider) wants to maximize his profits by playing high ROI options that could pop 1000%+ if he‚Äôs right
Is that irony? There is no guarantee that etf being approved will lead to short term gains in btc. Those 2 bets are entirely different tbh
Could be hedging a btc position if it‚Äôs a sell the news event, if btc sells off on approval they still profit. If it doesn‚Äôt then the btc position profits
most likely they already have a metric ton of btc already
Or he just needs a thrill üò≠
Both bets have the same expected risk-adjusted return.

The same probability of ETF approval (pre Jan 15th), is already priced in to both.
BTC is going to dump hard though when approval happens or soon after, he can take that money he wins and buy more BTC.
People out there that just like to play the odds
Or maybe he knows something that we don't.
He probably already has and then some. That‚Äôs probably left over change to him.
How do you do the math. All I see is 87cents
It‚Äôs a binary option contract. It either expires at 0 or expires at 1 dollar. He bought it at 87 cents, meaning he would make 13 cents, or roughly a 15% ROI payable if an etf is approved before the 15th
I think it means for every 87 cents bet you get a dollar plus your 87 cents. Seems insane
"Trader"
"Insider"
I think he wins. The fucks who run things wont give up their Vulcan Death Grip so easily.
But the Vulcan Death Grip isn't real.
History shows the SEC doesn't give a fuck!
I think it‚Äôs funny how so many people are tracking this event. As far as I‚Äôm concerned all it really means is institutions either get to play or they don‚Äôt. BTC going to kill it this year and into next regardless.

Everyone is too busy looking at 10ft in front of them when the real prize is much further out.
The ETF approval is the new China has banned/not banned BTC again..
ETF approvals (or not) have been around since at least 2017.
Be WILD if it's approved on January 16th.
praying for this dude. <3
Jan. 10 is the deadline for a response from the SEC.
Does that site use crypto like smart contracts for the betting or is it just a regular old centralized site that takes crypto as funding, like an exchange?
Smart contracts, it's non-custodial.
Insane website . I‚Äôm assuming there is dozens of websites like this ?
Isn't the deadline the 10th? And reapplying is in March?
That‚Äôs like when I bet $1000 to win $322 that the patriots would beat the giants.  Should have taken the other side and made $3340
I hope it gets approved on January 18th.

Pure speculation - if I had a tinfoil hat, I'd say the market receded because Whales and Institutional Buyers are likely manipulating the market price so they can maximize their profits post approval.
He ain‚Äôt wrong. It‚Äôll be approved early next week.
We hope so. Nobody knows yet.

Bruh just send me 10k to pay my ccs off if you wanna throw money away
Gary will deny the ETFs Jan 10th, then approve them Jan 12th just to fuck this guy over. Bet on it üòÇ
The Fed may start to cut rates by end of the quarter or next. Big players may front run the announcement first, before the Fed actually cut rates. General market correction or collapse across the board is very possible for the next 6 months.

You may look at similar correction on S&P 500 too.
Money laundering at its finest
Wouldn't it be 'finer' for money-in-money-out to bet on the 99% markets? Not the 81%.
During his childhood in the rural south, he was affectionately called 'Nathan' by family members.
Jan 15 is Martin Luther King Day - a federal holiday and a Monday - so it would likely have to be approved by Friday 12th to make that particular deadline.
That‚Äôs not trading lmao
BULLISH üêÇ
This is wild! Fingers crossed for dude. ü§û

‚Çølackrock
wow
Wow
Could argue this is just to cause more interest in the upcoming ETF. Stories like this spread pretty quickly... Probably lose when it gets rugged too, whales buy up on the cheap and THEN it is approved later in the year.
Looks like ima buy that 1k worth of BTC then...
Honestly for $.17 I kinda want to bet against.. deadline is so soon.
What is polymarket
Only 380k get that shit out of here. 
How is that worth writing an article lol.
What companies going to hold the ETF? That's the real question
If someone here feels like gambling a bit, remember to create a separate wallet, NEVER use your main wallet in those sites. I suppose that site is safe tho, but better safe than sorry.
This isnt just one trade by Kiwi. Theyve traded 124 times on this since 24 days ago. I wonder if this is hedge against another websites future options?
Pump&dump budget being spend. Worth a lot in ROI even if it will be rejected.
Lmao ballsy

Hi
He either has an insane amount of money and that amount is like $5 dollars to you and me or he knows something we don‚Äôt
Could someone convert 80% odds to european style?

80% odds means odds 1.2?
$379k on Grayscale or a different ETF? Knowing the target could be key. Any speculation?
How much can he win with his bet ? I feel like leverage trading is a better risk/result ratio
Where does one bet on things like this?
Good ol polymarket. I've never bet on that platform, but often go there just for the luls.

People will gamble on literally anything.
A new place to lose my money? Excellent‚Ä¶.poly market here I come

Not sure why they wouldn't just buy BTC instead but I guess someone out there has to take that bet
That‚Äôs a bold move‚Ä¶
cansomeone eli5 how this is different from TSE: BTCC.B ?
Plot twist..Gensler took other side of trade üí∞
That‚Äôs exactly how rich people do NOT think. They will waste money on shit but not spend money on a shit investment, even if it‚Äôs pocket change.
It‚Äôs how rich people may think, it‚Äôs not how wealthy people think. There is a difference in the world. There are plenty of idiots with lots of money.
It's EXACTLY how temporarily rich people think!
Lol. Twitter shareholders would like to thank you and Elon for having so much financial prowess.  /s
379k is a weird number for pocket change. why not make it 400k?
He's from the future. He's sending us a signal, that it's this cycle's top.
Except it can't pop 1000%.  It is a binary market.  He bought in at $0.85.  If right $0.85 pays $1.00 so max profit is $1/0.85 = 1.176 or a 17.6% gain.  If wrong the $0.85 goes to $0.00.  On Jan 15th his shares will be worth $1.00 or $0.00.  One of the other.

In dollar amounts he actually bet $322k which got him 379,600 Yes shares.  If right he gets paid $1 per share on 379,600 so $379,600 or a gain of ~$70k.  If wrong he loses $322k.
Then he must REALLY know something cause that‚Äôs a bad bet
lol thats such bad risk/reward.
Huh that‚Äôs terrible trade
Interesting. A horrible ROI/going in blind but an easy +70k with insider knowledge on approval, surely he must know something big
Maybe he meant 1000% annualized? I'm not about to try to do the math on that, though.
As time progresses I feel like he'd be able to buy out at varying prices, much like options
This guy maths hard
Put $300 into this bet. Put $3 million into BTC. The real bet is ‚Äùwill this bet push up the value of BTC‚Äù
Ding üõéÔ∏è
Absolutely correct, also it's a short term bet of 80% ROI.

This dude just wanted to gamble more.
> There is no guarantee that etf being approved will lead to short term gains in btc.

Short it then 

üëÄ
I didn't say it will dump, I'm saying there is no guarantee
When the gold ETF got approved many years back the price didn‚Äôt do anything.  Take that for what it‚Äôs worth
I think it's even worse: just 13 cents plus the original 87 cents. Or, another way to look at it, if you win either side of the bet, you get a dollar, but one side costs more to enter.
Okay word that‚Äôs the other possibility I considered. Interesting how people are betting on it going through though

How the smart contract knows the ETF has been approved?
Site itself is Polymarket, a prediction market platform, which uses [https://uma.xyz/](https://uma.xyz/) for resolving their markets.
Which blockchain does the smart contracts?
For what it's worth, I actually really like this distinction. I may start referring to people that received their wealth as rich and who earned it as wealthy. Thank you
I like your thinking. Some of us come from rags to riches. I‚Äôm still to get to the riches part but I‚Äôm getting there ;)
379k by Jan 15 confirmed
Yeah the big question is if this person is someone with actual inside info or just a degen gamblers.

Last time I saw something like this it was a question on if Tesla would accept Bitcoin for payment.  The question had been up for like a month or two and was down to two weeks left.  Some new player put $300k on Yes.  Three days later Tesla announced they were accepting Bitcoin as payment.
Just tried to look up whether or not gambling on a betting website is subject to the SEC's insider trading laws.

It's not clear that it is. 

A loophole for people with inside information?
Either this person is regarded or highly regarded.
That just sounds like regular insider trading
There‚Äôs enough dumb people with money in this world lmao 

This could be a trust fund kid who probably has the money to lose


Then again if you follow WSB then you‚Äôd realize people do this shit everyday and lose their earnings all the time 

Time will tell
One person can make a for and against bet at the same time.  


The market takes a cut, so it's not free.
Even if he knows something buying btc would b better
Wins the bet, makes 17% immediately. Cashes and buys BTC before run up and make more %
I mean, basically all signs point to it being approved already. I wouldn't be SHOCKED if it were denied, but I'm certainly expecting an approval.
Yeah I‚Äôm betting big on approval, still expect more manipulation down for the remainder of the month, but then biggly run up to halving in April.
In wsb defense the odds of winning or losing aren't laid out clearly like in this case. This dude here is betting too much to win not enough. Some dudes bet very little and win very big which is far better. You bet a little but stand to win a lot. One of these bets will work ü§™

Imagine yolo betting on a top league top team against an amateur team to gain x1.05 of your bet just for something freaky to happen and lose everything.
What if him and his associates have 40 million in BTC and they are ready to sell, but think making this public bet will pump BTC by at least 2%‚Ä¶ 

It only looks bad if you don‚Äôt have all the information, I‚Äôm sure these people have a strategy.
Or maybe he's just a moron.
Or maybe he‚Äôs an idiot
My thoughts exactly
It's a bad bet only if the probability of having an ETF approved by the 15th is less than 85 %.
In the gambling world some might call that picking up pennies in front of a steam roller.
one would think , it‚Äôs way to close to even money of a bet to risk that much for such a paltry return without knowing something
or a degenerate gambler.  Still it does make me leary of taking the other side of the bet where $0.15 on NO pays $1.00.  Those are nice odds but could be dead money.
But it's very likely.
/u/energeticentity is correct. You buy a contract at an amount between $.01 and $.99 and it expires worth $.00 or $1.00
So, if I understand correctly, he either wins $49270....or loses the whole $379000??

I'm not a betting man but that doesn't seem like a smart move.
ü§©üëäüèªüòé
That is very interesting, thankYou
Oracles are decentralized in name only. At the end of the day this is no better than some centralized gambling site with a VC ‚Äúdecentralized‚Äù sticker stamped on it.
Shameless plug to something that actually looks kinda sick
Yeah that is pretty cool. Worth picking some up on an exchange?
Any different from Augur (REP)?
It's not a loophole. The onus is upon the person with the information not abusing their access. How they do it is an implementation detail.
Insider trading is legal for Senators.
Corrupt AF
Insider trading is legal, in general. You just have to publicly announce your intentions. And they do‚Ä¶ you can look it up and make the same trades.
Halving typically is a nothing event, followed by a bull run over the next 0.5-2years. Narratives may be stronger in the mainstream these days, but history doesn't point to halving being a meaningful spike.
Agreed but the approval and halving being so close together seem to be sympathetic momentum events. Either way the next five years for BTC will be epic
do you think it makes a difference that the reward is going to be such a small number going from 6 to 3...

i feel like this will show in the market quicker than the last halvings but maybe not

just curious your take...
iirc in emergency cases polymarket uses kleros decentralised court which is pretty expensive to attack
I doubt it. It's relatively small compared to market movements these days, but long term of course the lower generation will have a positive price impact.
