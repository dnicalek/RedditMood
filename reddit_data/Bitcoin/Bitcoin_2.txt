I did it. I got banned by the butters. I know it‚Äôs not the most difficult task but I am quite disappointed that I only received a combined 97 downvotes. Poor show.
They are so sensitive. Says volumes about them. 

A reminder, that when Buttcoin was created, BTC was trading at $16. Ouch. No wonder they are so unhinged.
Buttcoin - Wrong for 12 consecutive years and counting.
Valiant effort, I think that's a pretty good score!
which r/ is this exactly? I'm reporting for duty here to do my part and become banned as well

What do y‚Äôall make of Max Kaisers FUD tweets as of late?
I don‚Äôt think I get what he was trying to say about the BTC ETFs being non convertible. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs an issue at all. As long as Fidelity and Blackrock et al still have to buy the underlying asset in equal parts to the AUM of the fund then that should satisfy all our hopes and best wishes for the success of these funds. Retail investors like our parents and our grandparents don‚Äôt have any design of being their own custodians of actual BTC. Frankly it‚Äôs just too complicated for the average person. Exposure to BTC in their retirement accounts is plenty good for them. I don‚Äôt think those same investors are going to be any less enthused if they knew they couldn‚Äôt convert their shares into actual BTC.
Max Keiser is a clown
I'm off twitter, too noisy.  


But what did he say?
thread about it was 'magically' removed by mods here, doesn't help...
Ignore any and all Bitcoin ‚Äòinfluencers‚Äô
Need more context if you want an opinion.
I think if he‚Äôs right, black market Bitcoin(NonKYC) is about to to start fetching a premium. It‚Äôs not just Max though‚Ä¶ Odell, and American Hodl have all been talking about this also.
What are your thought into this thought of mine? A Bitcoin etf essentially allows the financial institution to add Bitcoin to their asset sheet without the risk aspect of it due to the nature of how an etf works. With out an etf, they are subject to the volatility and potential collapse of Bitcoin. With an etf they are essentially hedging against losses if it were to occur since it would be pegged 1 for 1 with Bitcoin. In other words an etf allows them to have nothing to lose if bitcoin collapses. The losses would be only the gains from the initiation of the ETF? If I am correct on this, then we should be buying up as much as we can afford
Why wouldn't they be subject to the volatility or potential colapse? Am i missing something here?
No. If I buy one share of a Bitcoin ETF when Bitcoin costs $100 that moment, the ETF share will cost $100 because the ETF must acquire and hold that $100 worth of BTC. 

Later when the price of Bitcoin changes, the price of the ETF shares also changes. This is true for up and down changes. So if the price changes to $90 and the holder of the ETF share sells, they have a net loss of $10.
$10 per sat coming. You heard it here first üìà
*Stay stacking, my friends*
Isn't it a bit sensitive to care that there is a forum on the internet for people with an anti-Bitcoin views to converse with each other? And who is "they"? It sounds like a collective persona or consciousness concocted as part of a fantasy world where there are Bitcoin teams and rivals that need to be proven wrong!
They monitor our sub like a hawk, moan about bitcoin because most of them are in other FIRE subs and bitcoin is the asset of the last decade. They even have the audacity to say that we live in an echo chamber that bans anyone with an outside view. Now I can understand that view point to an extent but, pot calling kettle black? Ammerite?!
How do you know this unless you're doing exactly that which you have decided "they" do? You're even responding to someone who seems to be proud of doing this kinda shit on a subreddit for the topic "Bitcoin is a scam". It's embarrassing.
Buttcoin
An average year then
I thought he was referring to the US proposed bill to outlaw self custody, alongside the approval of the ETFs has the potential to set a standard where only big banks/corporations will be able to hold the actual asset, taking it away from the people... could be looking at different tweets though.
Oh he may have said multiple things then. I was referring to another thing he said where we should all be upset that the SEC is requiring these BTC ETFs be non convertible funds. To which I say ‚Äúeh whatever‚Äù 

To your point about the self custody law, I very highly doubt it‚Äôs a problem. I don‚Äôt see how they could enforce that. Nor do I see that holding up in the courts. Nor do I see it even getting passed in the first place. That one feels like a cart before the buggy story at this point
Elizabeth Warren's bill is a nothingburger.

Warren has introduced over 300 bills https://www.congress.gov/member/elizabeth-warren/W000817?pageSize=250

Not a single one of the bills she introduced has ever gone anywhere. None of them even passed the senate.
No, the NAV would change with the spot price. You're not missing anything.
That‚Äôs not really how an etf works . You buy ¬£100 pounds of etf ( the etf company buy ¬£100 at todays price ) and that‚Äôs it. They have zero exposure to price fluctuations ( up or down ) apart from up is better as your fees will be higher . For an ETF supplier the only important thing is ‚Äú your portfolio‚Äù value. I don‚Äôt get why people don‚Äôt get this‚Ä¶
I think you're talking about separate things.  /u/Secret_Operative is talking from the perspective of someone who buys a share of an ETF -- that share is 100% linked with the price movement of Bitcoin, up or down (plus a bit extra down due to management fees).  You're talking from the perspective of the ETF issuer -- they make money regardless of whether the price of Bitcoin goes up or down, since they're the ones collecting that fee.  They'd *rather* the price goes up, since they collect a percentage on a bigger pool of AUM (and it's easier to convince new investors to buy in if the underlying is going up), but they're making money either way.
I‚Äôm open to having a conversation with anyone. Civility and openness is the only way you can win minds. Being closed minded about anything is embarrassing, no matter the subject.
Just got paid my salary in BITCOIN!Man up and show us the SATS
you know it‚Äôs a shit ton if he censored it
Congratulations! This is amazing. I hope you‚Äôre getting partial payouts in cash too?
Congrats and welcome to the club. I‚Äôve been getting paid in crypto for about 6 years now. One of those rare circumstances where no one around me can directly relate.
What did you do to get paid in bitcoin?
I guess OP selling drugs
Probably it
Congrats!! that's the way
Amazing!
nice
Congratz man!
Be careful, Saylor‚Äôs disciples will bite you.
You're one of the early adopters. I salute you Sir.
Welcome to the club!
Damn yall got salaries?
I honestly don't understand this. It's great that you're adopting the new financial system, and that counts for a lot, but where BTC is so far away from becoming a globally recognised settlement system, I've never seen the point in being paid in BTC (currently)? Good stuff though, it's great to see the adoption growing :)
It‚Äôs all gotta start somewhere, and that‚Äôs the point.
Where do you live that your currency hasn‚Äôt eroded lately?
how many did you get
Nice man. I would move it to L1 when fees become reasonable.
Enjoy paying capital gains whenever you pay rent etc
Congrats. Cap gains when spent?
I‚Äôm sure
Only on gains, right? Or would it be on any of it since it is basically a salary ‚Äògift‚Äô
Only in a few countries. Not in mine
How did you convince your company?
His CEO is Mexican drug cartel leader
How do u pay ur bills ü§î
Use cashapp for a routing and account number as well as a debit card. Lightning transfer funds to your cashapp to pay bills with on the legacy debit card and account number system.
Congrats. You are literally living the dream.
Crash tomorrow confirmed
You got your salary in Wallet of Satoshi?
You know its little cus we are talking about sats and the censored area is fairly small! Not many 0s there
OPs alt bigging his 20,000 sats up
ü§£ü§£
Yep, this is true.....the more people that start building the bridge to the new system, the more people that can cross to it.......taking Jeff Booth's analogy from his amazing book :)
So stunning and brave!Could be fighting against wars, wold hunger, ecological collapses but no, this is the fight!These people are so confidently incorrect in their misunderstanding of Bitcoin, it‚Äôs truly impressive.

2024 is going to be an absolutely brutal year for them.
They created that subreddit over twelve years ago. 

It's been a brutal 12+ years for them. üòÇ
A moron on /r/buttcoin was trying to explain that Bitcoin's divisibility makes it inflationary.  I told them they don't get more fucking pizza by cutting it into more slices. 

The level of stupidity over there is borderline insanity.
>These people are so confidently incorrect

That's true of most of Reddit. The Hive Mind has been wrong about almost all major happenings over the last decade.
One of their highest upvoted posts of the last year is a "technical deep-dive" into why LN won't work, and despite the guy failing to understand one key concept that explains how nodes work in conjunction with each other to create an insanely complex, interconnected spiderweb to facilitate lots of small transactions the entire subreddit ate it up like potato chips because it confirmed their preconceived biases. Hell, just the other day they posted a screenshot that supposedly "proves that LN isn't growing anymore and it's dead in the water lol", despite all adoption curves across all sectors of tech throughout history growing asymptotically instead of linearly...which...duh. It's the same with that [one heavily flawed Dan Olson video](https://youtu.be/EyoMLR5MC9o?si=J_EqN_Q-G0urwCkR); these people want a moral high horse to ride upon (and occasionally make money themselves for doing so) so they can feel like a good person without actually attempting to understand with a critical eye what the hell they are yammering on about, and then they spread it all over the internet for other un-and-mis-informed people who don't really bother to pay attention (not those people's fault, really, tbh). Most of them are coming from a reasonable place of wanting less scams, which is great, but the loudest ones are JUST these people. Oh, and the people who didn't buy early when they should have/sold at a loss and are just trying to rationalize their cognitive dissonance. Oh well. History will continue to prove us right again and again and over the coming decades these dummies will get quieter & quieter and fewer & fewer in number. Keep stacking sats, y'all. Don't sell till you make a better life for yourself and your families.
They goin do their own version of the ace ventura einhorn is a man scene üòÉ
All they'll see is people buying the top. The glass could be 90% full and they'll only see that it's 10% empty.
Dunning krugers.
Heels dug so deep they buried themselves.
It never fails to baffle me the logical disconnect they perpetually live with. They call it a Ponzi because as the perceived value increases, the more people invest. By their logic all financial assets are Ponzis. It‚Äôs just a bit sad the bubble they live in on that sub, you can tell they‚Äôre broadly not financially literate.
Dunning krugers. Best ignored so they can wallow in their salt mine.
it is super salty in there that's for sure. I would love to see solid data on the number of buttcoiners that turned into bitcoiners, and the other way around.
They‚Äôre 1% the size of us. Definitely not the top 1% that‚Äôs for sure üòè
You would think BY NOW, maybe they'd be questioning if they just might be missing something. But nope. Remain ignorant.
If you think Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme, you don't know what a Ponzi scheme is.
This is what I don't understand, to be a Ponzi scheme there has to be a central authority controlling the inflow and outgoing funds, it's literally not possible for Bitcoin to be a Ponzi. 

Do they have zero understanding of Bitcoin or are they just lazy in using Ponzi to describe something they think is a scam?
To be fair, Reddit thinks American social security is NOT a Ponzi scheme, so this tracks.
...these people are like the flat earthers of finance. It doesn't matter what evidence is presented or how reputable the source, Bitcoin will always be a ponzi scheme to them.
This.

I really start pitying this pathetic bunch of morons. It's like watching the paranoid and psychotic inmates of a mental institution constantly banging their heads against the walls whilst shouting into the void but nobody takes notice and they're completely ignored. And they call us a cult... lmfao

Edit: Since they always monitor our sub I'm sure they're also coming here to downvote ~~or how comes all our posts here are w/o upvote til now...~~

Edit 2: I joined the party there, pure comedy gold so to speak... lol

Edit 3: Now I also have been permanently banned from buttcoin. Ohhh noooo. I also received as departing gift the badge "I'm a moron". What an honour! Cheers!
Don‚Äôt try to reason with people like this. They don‚Äôt know what Ponzi even means. It‚Äôs basically a euphemism for something bad in finance to them but they sure as hell can‚Äôt explain why.
Damn... you nailed it. Here take my updoot.
They are 1% the size of us. Comparable to Q-Anon, really.
Soon they'll be complaining that pension funds, asset managers, banks etc will offer BTC or BTC related assets, marketing everywhere and they will still be confuse about why every financial institucion is falling for the obvious 'ponzi squeme' all while bitcoin is trading at 7 figures, they are convinced they are right and no ammount of evidence or adoption will change their confused and scared little brain nuggets.
The fact that this guy has been mailing complaints to the editorial staff is HILARIOUS. 

Buttcoiners are so desperate to be right for once üòÇ
Wow. So triggered these boomers are emailing mainstream media outlets because their safe space is being violated. 

The part about ABC being their "trusted brand" really shows how brainwashed they are!
Can you imagine caring that much about what strangers spend their money on?
Time is also a scarce resource.  Building an echo chamber community dedicated to something you hate is a poor use for it.  For all their bashing, I don‚Äôt know a group more in Bitcoin‚Äôs thrall.  If something were to occur that upended Bitcoin or somehow rendered it moot, I would acknowledge that I missed a detail or consideration.  They would rather die than consider they might be incorrect.
My guess is at least some of these people lost a lot of money on Bitcoin and don't want to be reminded of it. It's the only explanation for being so upset at just seeing Bitcoin mentioned on TV.
I can't imagine people basing personalities around hating...a thing.

Touch grass. Get some sun. Hug someone.
This is exemplary for most ‚Äúsocial warriors‚Äù playbook‚Äôs these days. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to see the BTC price as I think it‚Äôs a ponzi so it should be removed‚Äù. 
 
1. They see something they don‚Äôt agree with, that triggers them, that upsets them or reminds them of something they don‚Äôt like.

2. They don‚Äôt *agree/appreciate/whatever* with it so nobody should be allowed to and they‚Äôll strive to have it *removed/censored/cancelled/sanitized*.

3. They‚Äôll call anybody, that calls them out that they‚Äôre in no position to decide for everybody what is and isn‚Äôt allowed, a *insert whatever extremist or -ism*.

4. Repeat steps for next target.

They‚Äôre not open to learn, there‚Äôs no dialogue possible, all they want is compliance to their views. It‚Äôs so incredibly egocentric.
imagine being part of a group whose sole identity centers on hating something it doesn‚Äôt understand.
The buttcoiners will have an aneurysm when the ETF finally goes live
They'll find a way to cope with it - probably some conspiracy theory - to continue their futile crusade...lol
‚ÄúThat would help me out.‚Äù

bahahahaha üòÇüòÇü§£ü§£
Buttcoin is the epitome of tradfi circlejerking. Those types lack vision and will buy in on Bitcoin via an ETF when Bitcoin is at 250k. They will deserve that high price because they are closeminded. When the ETF gets approved that sub will be in shambles because many of those men need institutions and governments to tell them how to think. They are followers who will never make real money because they think the tradfi system is the best system. I can‚Äôt wait for Jan 8-10 2024!
When people are so ignorant they refuse to contemplate anything outside their biases could possibly be correct, all you can do is laugh at them and ignore them really

Especially as the implication here is they might not support the concept of free speech either and may be willing to use violence to prevent people talking about the prices of things just because they don't like them, if so these are the types of people that allowed authoritarian regimes to become a reality
When asked, all this and always under the pretence of "helping others not to fall for this scam". How fucking selfless taking care of other peoples finances... Idiots.
That‚Äôs the issue with society in general. I feel like a lot of people would cheer and fully embrace a totalitarian, censoring, safe space creating, rubber tiling the world, government as long as said government aligns with their social/political/world views. In this example, removed BTC prices. Or made X illegal. You get the idea.

The danger is that for some reason they don‚Äôt realize that that might be great for them at first but that the fun stops when that government starts doing things they don‚Äôt agree with. Or that they‚Äôre all of a sudden do things that the government doesn‚Äôt agree with.

Open a history book people, jeez üòÇ
I got banned there after my very first post
Same lol. They can't even hear an opinion that isn't litteraly "btc s a ponzi".
But hey... It's good for us... Their kids will work very hard to earn some sats :)
Got banned for saying banks are insolvent and in case of a bank run (like with FTX) most of them would collapse. The guy said banks are solvent because they can get BAILED OUT lol. And banned me. Pure comedy
Me too.
I managed to get 7 or 8 posts and started a thread - then got banned, all in the space of about 20 minutes. Im glad to be out haha
The Butts trashing those leaving Rome, while they stay behind throwing dinner parties while Rome gets sacked and burns all around them.
"ABC is one of our most trusted brands" 

Fuck that poor guy is delusional, ABC is government funded propaganda and he thinks Bitcoin is the problem.
It's so sad that my savings went 150 % up in value this year, please don't tell anyone, my savings are a scam.
I‚Äôm banned from commenting or posting in Buttcoin! Lmao

I take it as a badge of honor.
same. as someone who is interested in the psychology of groups, I attempted to engage in good faith to better understand their perspective, but not surprisingly got ripped to shreds, then banned. messaged the mods asking what rule I violated and they did not respond. 

lots of hate, jealousy, bias, and misunderstanding happening over there. actually very sad.
I found out today I was banned trying to comment on this very thread.
Lol, the saying "Misery loves company" comes to mind. Salty buttsnacks need an echo chamber to legitimise their saltyness.
Lol. They are angry at something we did not even ask for!
This is all probably based on negative emotions - they failed to identify greatest opportunity in lifetime.
Crazy part is that sub has been around since 2011. So they actually identified bitcoin but faded it for the the last 13 years. Can you imagine how much you‚Äôd hate yourself if you did that too? I know I would.
Everybody will buy Bitcoin at the price they deserve.
I was what would be considered a buttcoiner. I did flames on the internet against btc, even if I knew it since at least 2012/13. I really got into btc when I read the whitepaper and started going through the rabbit hole. I cannot erase that butthurt approach I had, and I also was following the whole narrative about drugs, terrorism etc. I was that close to buy btc on paper wallet (yes, that era), but I was shitting in my pants thinking I was doing something illegal or shady. I really discovered btc at the price I deserved, and so will all the other people who have not looked into that. It‚Äôs sad, awesome, hurtful, joyful‚Ä¶ btc comes at you, it can be sweet or it can be bitter, but you are always a couple of clicks or taps away from it. Happy 2024 to all!
There's some fuckin seriously bitter people out there. Who cares what someone else does with their money?
I wonder how many buttcoiners are flat earthers at the same time.
No, these guys follow the predetermined thought patterns that their masters indoctrinate them with - there's no room for free thought.
These guys are flat earthers of the future. People won't understand why they exist or where they came from but they will be considered idiots.
This makes no sense.
I feel like bitcoin is programmed to make people go crazy looking at price everyday.  Buttcoin may be the result of that ‚Äúbutters relapse‚Äù.  Need to have strong diamond hands to win this game.  Market rewards patience
It's so satisfying to looks like them so desperate like this. LOL.
These people are the most insufferable humans in existence. They are like the financial equivalent to incels
I‚Äôve been telling ya, the earth is flat, but the news‚Ä¶..
How confident they are!!
üòÜüòÇü§£ü§Æ
[removed]
Please don't encourage users to brigade.
They have nothing better to do, it‚Äôs pitiful.
Suck it buttcoin chodes!
Some people are god awfully retarded
>or recovering butters relapse 

Also called a prolapse.
These people need to get a life. Imagine if they used that much energy to do something positive instead.
In other words "I don't understand crypto and I haven't made any profit from it so I'll just hate it" dumbass.
More funny is that at some point they are going to be invested in bitcoin without knowing it.

If you invest in the S&P500 you make money because somewhere some civilians get bombed..  And I'm pretty sure Microstrategy will be in the S&P500 very fast and then they hold shares of the biggest bitcoin hodler lol.
Imagine hating gold for it‚Äôs existence then ranting about it.
"as the ABC is one of our most-trusted brands"

They don't get a lot of of praise and recognition these days
s/buttcoin/butthurt/
Every time this guy sees the price he gets reminded of all the missed gains.

Instead of admitting he was wrong and buying, he wants to hide the price.
This feels like a troll post to me
I got banned with my first post there when I asked them how they feel right now (btc was just breaching 20k that year).  
Sad bunch of loosers... all I can say.
These people must have amazing lives if this stuff bothers them.
With the time he spent going through the complaints process he could have actually learned about Bitcoin.
Damn, its fun to join that group and upset their nonsense lol. Damn they are stupid.
Always a good laugh with those guys
It really is, I‚Äôm banned so I can‚Äôt comment but I browse on occasion. 

Just saw a post that said a guy knew about bitcoin for 12 years and he‚Äôs glad he never invested in it. 

It was either a troll post or the most financially illiterate person on the planet. 

HURR DURR IM SO GLAD I HAVENT INCREASED MY WEALTH
I can't wait foe the comedy show from that sub the next couple years. I may subscribe and get updates...laughter is good for the soul.
At this point they are fully committed.  They've been on that subreddit for 12 years fully aware of the opportunity cost they have squandered.  The only way they can square that is to someday... somehow... see it fall below what they could have bought it for all that time ago.
They're retards, arrogant retards
The people on that subreddit are pretty much the type of people I hate having conversations with. Always thinking they are more intelligent than everyone else but at the same time complaining. Just sucks the absolute life out of you having to listen to them.
When the price went up this past month there was a post in that subreddit coping with it. And I commented something like "coping levels through the roof" and I was permanently banned. üòÇ

I once checked that the sub was created very early, like 2012, if people had invested in Bitcoin back then, they would be millionaires.

So it is just full of butthurt people that regret not investing into Bitcoin.
The only feeling I have after reading that, is pity. It's the same feeling I get whenever I read a Peter Schiff tweet. Getting proven wrong over, and over, and over again. Yet still being so confident in their misinformed delusions.
This guy Sounds like a liberal leftist lol
A bunch of morons who aped into some Alt, got recked, and formed a community around being a bunch of fiat Maxi losers.

They remind me of the people who tried to stop the internet or the automobile when it was created.  If Reddit has been around back then, they would be a bunch of "Horse Maxi's" writing to their Congressmen to stop the automobile.  Actually that is exactly where the term "Red Flag" comes from.

A bunch of Horse Maxi's got their equivalent of Elizabeth Warren to require a person with a red flag to walk in front of all the cars to "protect" the public from the automobile.
I‚Äôm all for healthy criticism. But I‚Äôve long suspected that Buttcoin is mostly smart and wealthy people who benefit greatly from the fiat system. So they‚Äôre smart enough to see the flaws of Bitcoin, but refuse to admit the necessity of such a reliable peer to peer system because its success would mean great trouble for their gilded cage.
Sooo, they are anti-Free Speech?...
I imagine a lot of them don‚Äôt even know what they are. It‚Äôs hard to have a personality when your world view consists of disproven parroted talking points and propaganda.
I can‚Äôt understand being so triggered over a number on a screen
I know about bitcoin since the first bull run and i only being buying since about 18 months ago
Who gives a rats ass what they think over there.

Stack sats and stay humble
We give a rat's ass (otherwise the thread wouldn't be so long)...

Besides it's fun studying and psychological dissecting another species...lol
This individual falls into the Warren and Dimon camp. They want paper money. Paper money with a limitless supply. Or CBDC so they can issue you a social credit score for not being their model citizen.
I feel like the Buttcoin Reddit is filled with people that probably don‚Äôt traditionally invest either that haven‚Äôt ‚Äúrun that inflation math‚Äù or really delved deep into the literal insanity of the money printing by the Fed.

If they did they wouldn‚Äôt think BTC was insane at all.
Normies hate seeing bitcoin go up because they know they missing out
"iT's NaUSeaTinG!!!11"
‚ÄúI‚Äôm literally shaking right now‚Äù
Butters was born in September 11th. Think about that
I'm convinced that whole sub is just bots now
I've heard questioning the news makes you an anti-science conspiracy nut job. They should stop crying fake news and just do what the box tells them to.
Oh man the buttcoin
Lol I commented on that thread telling the OP essentially what a loser he is for obsessing over this and their sub downvoted me.
Next they'll give you a "Ponzi Schemer" or "warning, I am a moron" flair next to your username and if you keep commenting without sounding like a complete idiot, then they will permanently ban you from their sub. 

The only bitcoin supporters they don't ban from their sub are the ones that post idiotic comments and they just keep those ones around so they can publicly make fun of them.
Lol. I guess he can't stand to see the price now, he wants the news to stop showing it. Hilarious.
Losers
Max pain is UP
I just realized they view the bulls as people relapsing and bears when they're in recovery
First they ignore you then they laugh at you then they fight you then you win
boomers are the main voter base in their countries and are used to pulling off that kind of stuff
Imagine getting angry about Bitcoin‚Äôs legitimacy üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòá
They‚Äôre probably afraid their partner finds out the price dropped too much and that they lost money
I like sheep meat, I always liked it.
It would be interesting to analyse if current sub posters have been around since it's inception.
Werd
Wow people really got time on their hands! Must be nice...
I lose brain cells everytime I fancy a quick look there.
Buttcoin is satire, isn‚Äôt it? It certainly reads like it is, just tons  of straw arguments‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. it has to be satire.
Elizabeth Warren has entered the chat
What a twat.
Booolish
Unfortunately, in a world governed by the law of attraction, it's not possible to fight against what you don't want to get what you want
They will die, we all will die before bitcoin does
They can't understand that we'd rather keep our money on the first and only legitimate deflationary monetary ledger instead of in their stupid inflationary system.

"money is for spending, not saving".  - some clown over at r/ butthurt
sounds like someone sold all their BTC for $5 hate to see it
üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Imagine being this karen
TIL Im Butter
This guy was ‚Äúwaiting for $20k‚Äù after it hit $30k
Turn if off.
I love how the butt coin people thing they are so right, and yet their sub doesn‚Äôt even have 200k individuals who believe their nonsense. Meanwhile, the btc sun is over 5 million people. At what point do they capitulate?
Honestly I just feel sad for them. Yes they are losing money, but also such a waste of time.
wow that sub must be full of regrets bitcoin was basically free 12 years ago
It‚Äôs full of salt
Someone did some digging and people in that sub have been saying Bitcoin will crash to $0 even when it was around $50. 

A decade and so later, it's about $40k. Who are the clowns now ü§£
Haha, that's hilarious! The dumb fucks have been sitting on a treasure trove all this time and they missed it lol. No wonder theyre so bitter.
Could you imagine knowing about Bitcoin in 2011, being obsessed with it for the last 12 years, and not making any money?  I would find it very hard to live with myself.
I think you just nailed why a lot of them seem so angry about bitcoin. 

If I thought something was dumb I‚Äôd mock it probably but I wouldn‚Äôt obsessively post angrily about it like a lot of them do.
They're trapped in a lifelong sunk cost fallacy.  A lot of those people could be millionaires a few times over by now.  They have to continue as they are.  Admitting that they were wrong when being wrong cost them so much is too hard to cope with.
I first ventured into that sub in 2013, had no idea what crypto was that was my first introduction, it seemed like there was this new tech thing that was niche and with lots of problems and this sub was a light hearted place where enthusiasts of this new thing could joke about the problems, because why would you care about this small thing unless you were into it.

Of course I ignored the space until 2018, and went back to that sub and have been watching it since, way more bitter and it gets worse as crypto refuses to die, there are user names I recognise they post almost daily, I can't imagine being this engrossed in something you hate, I focus on this space full time but holy shit these guys are more emotionally invested than I am financially.
One of the great things about bull runs is how they f**k with the heads of anti-bitcoin people. Not only the confusion and frustration, but the feeling of missing out and watching everyone else make money that you know they also have.
Worrying about money you could have made is such a trap. It‚Äôs like that guy who basically ruined his life because he‚Äôs obsessed with the hard drive he threw away with tens of thousands of BTC on it.

At the end of the day you can‚Äôt live in the past.
Suddenly you made me feel bad for them. I'd lost my mind in such a case too.
NO dude you got it all wrong.  As one of the r/ butthurt tools said; "We know its going up, we just don't want to scam people out of money by participating".

So morally righteous!  I'll sit on my couch since they're already on the cross.
üòÇüòÇ man fuck those moronic imbeciles. Jesus fucking christ
I have absolutely no sympathy for people like them.
Lmao, no wonder they‚Äôre so salty over there
I remember 8 years ago reading that sub.

It's funny because even then the sentiment here was the same "Haha those guys have been at it for over 4 years"
Cognitive dissonance or bias is hard to shake. At some point you pass the threshold of time where going against what you believed is so unfathomable it‚Äôs difficult to bring oneself to change opinion.
Some fuckwit on there was saying that because bitcoins price is volatile that it makes it inflationary. Absolutely clueless, yet they think they are so smart.
"money is for spending, not saving!" 

\-some clown over at r butthurt actually said this
I‚Äôve heard that absolutely insane argument too. Thank you for the pizza analogy. That one‚Äôs going in a drawer.
Reddit for me is all about smaller  subs where people interested in some niche topic can gather and exchange info.

Large mainstream reddit subs are so redacted, it‚Äôs painfull to watch.
A grim example is the buttcoin sub itself, one of their rules forces people to put crypto values in air quotes because "it's all fake" (paraphrasing, I went to that sub like 3 times so I don't remember the actual text)
If you were to look up finances all time bonehead plays. You might read about a subreddit called buttcoin that missed a sub 1 dollar bitcoin in the closing seconds of 2011.

*breathes in*

What you wouldn't read about is how these butthurts lost their mind to envy and turned r/buttcoin into a support group for butthurts only to watch the price constantly rise cheering for drops that were still 100x higher than when the subreddit was started and losing their minds on bull markets not realizing that even dollarcost averaging from the absolute top would have them in profit today which only further compounds until all they have left is regret in anger as they conspire in a diabolical scheme to get even with Dan Marino.
üòÇüòÜüôåüèª
lmao, bravo
Aaaaaaaaaaaalrighty then!
Laces out!
I think the correct plural form is ‚Äúdunnings kruger‚Äù
Lol Yes!
They make up their own rules about what a ponzi scheme is.   They have posts and posts about this, and its funny how they carefully manipulate their premises about what a ponzi scheme actually is to make sure you can't include anything else BUT bitcoin.
Most of them are clearly intellectually lazy and at the same time super confident that they are right.

The worst combination lmao.
A good example of Dunning-Kruger in action.
Ignorance and hubris, we're all susceptible without vigilance
Most people operate on feelings, not facts. If someone already hates Bitcoin and thinks it's a scam, they're probably just going to accept it at face value if they hear someone call it a Ponzi. If they already believe it's right, why would they check if it's wrong? Most people don't.

You can quote facts at them all day, but they will reject everything you say if it doesn't "feel right." Studies show that when people's ideas are challenged, they rarely change their mind‚Äîthey just embrace their original views even harder. Even when they're wrong.
Nobody said they were smart. Don‚Äôt underestimate the capacity people have for being complete idiots
I assume they believe there is a hidden actor controlling things

In their defense, a lot of shit coins operate this way. Of course, they can't be bothered to make the effort to read the code or even the white paper
No dude you got it all wrong!  When I'm 70, If I'm lucky to be alive, I'm going to bathe in my amazing -4% ROI in social security payments that won't even cover my property taxes.
Hilarious isnt it?
I wanna laugh but it's so sad lol hahahaha
Well said. They seem to be more obsessed with btc than people that are actually holding. The whole thing must be exhausting.
Lots of them lost money on Shitcoins and they put Bitcoin in the same bracket to make themselves feel better. There is no second best.
They've already created the theory that institutions are only creating ETF's so they can get their fees off investors who want to buy in the "scam". The logic is asinine.

They also ignore all the large companies, which are publicly traded on the U.S. stock market adopting/working with crypto developers now to incorporate blockchain technology in their services.
>institutions are only creating ETF's so they can get their fees off investors who want to buy

Well, that's why institutions creates ETF's in general: to collect fees. Hard to disagree here.
> They'll find a way to cope with it - probably some conspiracy theory - to continue their futile crusade...lol

There's certainly no shortage of conspiracy theories around blackrock
"Of all tyrannies, a tyranny exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It may be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron‚Äôs cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience."

Great quote. Thanks.

Sounds like he predicted the Woke/ESG movements...
Absolutely, just posted this so throwing it in again:

Also this;

First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out‚Äîbecause I was not a socialist.

Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out‚Äîbecause I was not a trade unionist.

Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out‚Äîbecause I was not a Jew.

Then they came for me‚Äîand there was no one left to speak for me.

‚ÄîMartin Niem√∂ller
same. 

my post asked why they post about how rapid drops in value indicate extreme volatility, but they don't post when the prices increases in the same manner. 

that question was not well-received. takeaway is that their volatility claims are only of concern when price is moving in a direction that makes them feel sad. slight bias going on over there.
I already roll my eyes reading the subreddit name. "Bitcoin!? Aha, more like BUTTCOIN!"

One of the rules is that they can abuse you but you cant abuse them back lol. Bunch of cucks
What a surprise - right on time for Xmas...lol
I know. What am I going to do all day on the 25th now?!
Exactly. Many of them would be living different life if not for their own stupidity.
Salt take city
They were saying the same thing back in October 2011 when a single bitcoin was worth less than $3

Imagine if they just spent ten bucks and bought a few bitcoins instead of making fun of it...
Most of them did, but lost it or sold it during bear markets or waited too long for the dip and they are now full of saltiness and regret. That's basically what unites that sub.
100%
1 part FUD, 1 part salt, let bake for a decade or so
They don't really have to, most people can just quietly leave that subreddit and buy bitcoin, no one is keeping tabs on who was a buttcoiner to shame them for it.

They stay because they truly believe that bitcoin is wrong and are fools for it.
It's not about peer pressure to stay.  It's an emotional crutch for them.
They aren‚Äôt creating the ETFs and collecting fees because they think BTC is a scam and they‚Äôre looking to cash in on ‚Äúgreater fools‚Äù

They are creating them because they believe BTC is going to be a valuable asset and continue to grow in the coming decades so they want to offer it and cash in on the huge profits that are to come.

The theory is in the reason, not whether or not institutions want profit from fees.
*"bItCoIn iS fInIsHeD!"* \~Proclaimed with utter confidence for the 537th time in a dozen years.
I think it's not the same morons who doubted Bitcoin from the begining. Every year the previous ones, get their mouth shut and new ones come along to take their place, keeping the sub going. Morons coming in waves.
Exactly this. And it is a very easy mindset to succumb to. I remember a time when this happened to me. Shortly after having sold my 2 BTC, that I bought for $200, for $1k each, I became super salty after seeing the price rise to $20k a few months later. Oh I was so angry. It only took me a couple of weeks to snap out of it and I started to accumulate again, but for a short time I had convinced myself that Bitcoin was "on the way out anyway", and I wanted nothing to do with it anymore, all because that was easier than to just admit that I underestimated it big time and thereby lost out on a large amount of money. Ofcourse the problem was with me, not with Bitcoin.

I was wrong. It was hard to admit that. But you know what? I‚Äòm fucking glad that I did, because I got a second chance and it was probably the best financial decision of my life that I‚Äòm incredibly grateful for.

Sometimes you gotta taste some humble pie and face the music. The people of r/buttcoin could not do that, and I feel sorry for them.
‚ÄòIn Argentina, contracts can be settled in Bitcoin‚Äô ‚Äî foreign ministerJokes aside, this is more bullish than not.
Milei is super pro Bitcoin and he has only been there for 10 days, he has at least 4 more years as President, expect more Pro-Bitcoin legislation to come to Argentina. Maybe the second country to copy El Salvador.
Except for the debt renegotiation with the IMF
the country's in really bad shape, it's gonna take a whole lot of work to get it up on its feet again
The goal is a _stable_ currency
And milk too! And cows ! Brilliant!
Does it means no gains taxes anymore?
Lol, no. It just means it's legal
So it begins‚Ä¶
Not only bitcoin, any other cryptocurrency will do. People will be able to select which currency and coin :)
Exactly. We can do it legaly with no taxes! Its sooo good to be Argentine today, i voted for Milei. VIVA LA LIBERTAD CARAJO!
I wouldn't have downvoted you for that. It is good news. If people here think the other projects will all die out, sorry that ain't gonna happen.
Is it not perfect for international contracts? No arguing about which country's currency to use -- just use Bitcoin.

Expect some transaction between El Salvador and Argentina -- probably two private companies -- any day now. Will do a small proof of concept first.
Good first step.
What does that mean? You can use bitcoin as payment method?  Can‚Äôt you do that in US as well?
