I dips me lid to ya.
It’s been a pleasure front-running the institutions with you gentlemen.
Ladies too dawg.  Quite a few too.
The UTXO set went from 4GB to 10GB in 2023
I feel regret for not buying bitcoin when it was 30K... should I wait to buy when it hits a lower price point?
Trying to time the bitcoin market is for fools.
Yeah wait until it’s 50k
Should have lumped sum by now, and then small amount of DCA going forward depending on your budget.
Are you for real?
Depends on your time horizon. If you don’t need the money anytime soon the time to invest would be now.
yeah just wait a bit more and buy at 3k 💀💀
First.
>First.

Yes, we're all very impressed.
Good sir, I am a lady… no matter what is written on that bathroom wall.
And all the things that run tangential or congruent to that!
🚀Happy New Year!

Tell them to chill I’m trying to buy more tomorrow
Buy high hodl low

Same tbh
Does this mean I can have a girlfriend now?
Only if you eat your peas.
Does this mean I can have a boyfriend now?
This is the Pumpening. Get in.
LFG
What’s causing this?
People realizing institutions are here
The world is waking up. Huge demand for BTC right now and it will continue in this year. Get ready
Nothing 

People betting on ETF approval Jan 10

It's going to be a pump and dump with painful rise up after to shake out weak hands
Possible ETF approval this week and stock traders investing 2023 gains into BTC
Just pure euphoria of the new year.
2024
One of the not financial advisors on YouTube said once the price is within 20% of the ATH the line goes up with a magnetic pull like force.
nice!
FRRRRR I WAS LIKE 45???
Sheit na’sayin dis bich bout gon blow tha fuck up sheeeeeiiiit
TO THE FUCKINGGGGGGG MOOOOOOON
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
In response to the recent big price moves, Senator Elizabeth Warren was quoted as saying "Holy canoli ding dong applesauce po po po."
It’s a Cherokee family recipe
Moon? I was thinking Jupiter
Do not Redeem!
so glad i bought at $19k
My cost basis is around 16.5k. I timed the bottom perfectly. But because I'm a moron, I deployed only 10% of my fiat and didn't want to buy any more after the price went over 30k. Oh well.
I wanna spend 5 k
So my post talking about the 2024 bull run is flagged but this isn’t?
This post is about rockets and graphs
The first rule of /r/bitcoin is you’re not allowed to talk about price
What a new year for new highs
Check again and in just three in 300 just see I’m scared trow 5k in but so temted
The more people doubt Bitcoin, the more it goes up
🇺🇲2024 ABOUT TO BE EPIC 🇺🇲
LFG
Strap yourselves in
Oof! 

All those who refuse to buy NOW, will feel like they've been hit by a truck, very soon.
Shit I wanna grow in 5k asap
Now wait till you see the passive influx of billions from the ETF
Could you stop rising for 5 min....


Me : *sobs *....I don't have enough yet ...
Ain't happening! Lol
No, please no!!! I haven't bought enough yet!!!
You had 1.5 years.
If it’s going to push through $45k then it’ll do so because it’s the new year.
Crash before etf, we are way too bullish rn, I usually go against the crowd when we get this bullish
Nah man we won’t, people will FOMO the etf announcement. We’re headed to 48k then eventually 52 and then we might see a 20% pullback right before the halving
Honestly half the crypto crowd is worried about a major sell the news event, we might not be bullish enough😂 I do believe a pullback is due but no one can know when it will actually happen
Opposite, pump 15% around ETF approval then dump 30-50% to levels from 2-3 months ago is my guess 

People are too bullish and can't handle the shakeout that's coming. 

I'm putting my money where my mouth is and selling around ETF approval switching to BITI then back the BTCX.B (Canadian spot ETF I've had the whole time) in the summer/fall
Gonna be a good pullback at some point soon
I'm hoping for the same. Reminds me of a time with all the superbowl commercials. Also, does anyone remember Bakkt? It was supposed to be the best thing ever since sliced bread, and then all of a sudden everyone stopped talking about it because the price action didn't follow. Same could happen now. I'm hoping it does.
🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕🌖🌖🌖🌕🌕
We are so back 💪
Haha I knew I should have bought that dip, oh well. I'll let the FOMO win again. 🏆 🚀
Post needs more 🚀🚀🚀

New year, new highs.

LFG
Thanks for the sell signal

It’s coming down. I’m about to max two taxed advantaged accounts but can’t get the money moved fast enough. Buy the dip after I lump sum
I guess Saudi Arabia and the UAE officially joined BRICS.

Probably dumping their usd into btc for now since they don't need usd.
Don’t remind me of my short pls !!!! :(
Man i wish i owned more
All in guys. All in.
Glad I bought more on New Years Day 👍
Sorry to wish a late Happy New Year to all of my fellow friends on this page. It's the first time this year, the first time in this month that because of potential ETF approval, we can see a sudden spike of up to 6% in BTC and luckily if somebody is holding a ratio of alts or BTC might be gain. Looking around the corner with different CeX to assess 24hrs top gainers. TIME and VV are skyrocketing 🚀 available in both the exchanges Bybit and Bitget, and AGLD in Binance with a 31% increment in the last 24 hours. We're doing good 👍
I just woke and saw that my longs on Nexo are rocking it and added more liquidity to my position! Lest gooo!
possibly between 30-40 but I think just one more time.
Having a buddy over?
Me and you only.
But there's only one hole 😲
That would suffice, LFG
you can insert it from both directions though
It’s inevitable, like bitcoin
Two in the pink…
This is the only logical example
Best I can do is $3.50
I cum in peas ☮️
How can you have any meat if you don't eat your peas?
Eww why is it green?
is that a strong glass of FOMO on the rocks u just served him?
"It's going to be a pump and dump with painful rise up after to shake out weak hands"

- Sideliners' prayer
Aka the haters that didn’t invest
I sure hope so. Need to stack more sats
Or it will go into a 7 year bull run :')
I deadass thought this was a diff language at first💀
Hahaha all English but with a sprinkle of steeze.
Ur getting downvoted because none of these fucker know what language you’re talking haha 🤣
Hahaha I won't lose sleep at night because I have that flavour rolling off my tongue! SHEEEIIIITTT
Upvoted for *she-it*
POW wow wanton soup hoe ass
Only once? I bought all the way up to 69K, all the way back down to 16K and back up again. My most recent buy was 42K and I'll buy at whatever it's at next month.
This is literally posting about a picture of the price. I posted a picture of the king of Rohan at helms deep saying so it begins…next time I’ll just post a picture of a rocket with LFG.
Rules is rules
Go on
I want another 1.5 years please
BTC long term is bullish, hell 2024 is bullish. Short term we are over bought and due for a correction. The etf will be a dumpfest.
We're still 24k under ATH and that's after several years of high inflation, which realistically makes the real value difference more like 30k.
Good call but we’re too early for a “dumpfest”, longs will do their best at taking good profits before proceeding with a dump ;)
Do you ever stop and think, "I'm an embarrassing idiot" when throwing out really specific predictions like this?
Of course, I’ve got my own opinion like you have your own. It’s a 50/50 game bud :D
Dumb Indian scammer doesn’t get the joke🙄
[removed]
My portfolio is 99.5% crypto and .5% weed stocks.

Not quite enough to retire but might be able soon even if we just get to previous ATH. I have been buying since 2017

I'm fully balls in but also not stupid to realize there is a dump coming.
> crypto 

ugh.  Shitcoins.  That explains it.
Right. It isn't going to a new ath before at least retesting the bull market support band if not the 100 week. But I'm here for the blind over excitement.
Aka Bitcoiners that want more Bitcoin before institutions get in
Short term dumpy action coming either way 🤷‍♂️
That’s what everyone expects, I’m afraid.
No I looked at your post history, dumbass.

New account, comment karma farming, asking people to buy your gold, buy your bitcoin… actually even one comment you asked some guy for his 5k to invest for him.

Anyone reading this report this guy👆
BTC will have a boring move this cycle but I still hold

I don't even think it will pass 89k USD but I'd like to be proven wrong if it does.

The real money is in shitcoins. You want to 10-100x your money (and also lose 99% of it if you hold too long) this is where it's at.

If I can afford to spend thousands on random shitcoins whenever I please and it only be less than 1% of my portfolio why not. I'm not hurting you if I win I buy more BTC if I lose I just invested money I can afford to lose

At least I'm honest with myself and admit this is all just gambling unlike everyone else who pretends they are in it for the tech or awaiting Bitcoin Jesus second coming.
> BTC will have a boring move this cycle

Shitcoiners always talk about their shitcoins being the next big thing.  Then they get rekt, and disappear.
I don't think it will reach prev ATH until after summer or fall 2024

The ETF approval may get it to around 55-57.5k USD is my guess then a 30-50% drop after.
I was thinking more like summer or fall 2025 before it breaks the 2021 ath, but who knows. If I can manage to sell at 55 and buy back at 30 then I'm more than happy to hold all the way to the next blow off top
45k was mega boner resistance back in 2021. The volume isn't there right now and this run can't even hold above 45k.
You’re right buddy, let’s see what rolls out at the end of this week ✌️
Cos you find it so offensive to be called Indian I’m guessing you’re in Pakistan then? 😂
I’d be embarrassed if I was Indian too
Scamming prick? Yes you are
Congratulations everyone, 45k is here.Congratulations to all hodlers and those with conviction. you deserve this.It’s been an honor stacking with you below 50k
🫡
Your hard work and dedication are paying off. lol
$50k by weekend
I choose to believe you
Pls no. I’m on vacation and my bank froze my account because I tried to move a larger sum into my brokerage from abroad. Praying there is a little dip by mid-next week!
Gentlemen, it was a pleasure stacking with you all below 40k.

See yall again in 2wks.
🤣🤣🤣 Facts!
45k has been here before, swings like this are perfectly normal and not outliers.
Ye but usually steady from 42, not low 42 high 45 over night like now. This is an outlier, 7+ percent increase overnight for BTC market cap is solid
The bump is due to the BTC ETF possibly being approved by Jan 5.  Maybe Whales know something we don't.
You don't? 

I am all in since 26k
Yep. Captain Ahab is on his way.
Careful. Short covering in progress.
So what?
Again. Again… Again.
why this? only because is janurary 1st? just pure euphoria of the new year?
Speculation of early ETF approvals this week is likely driving the price. I hope the approval is quietly delayed (not announced) until next week to allow a cooling off period before January 10th.
This might be the pump before the dump if the early approvals (Tuesday or Wednesday of this week) do not happen. Proceed with caution.
It's been here before kid 
We need 1 million. Before that, don't even consider selling
The more reliable bitcoin price prediction soures slow a slow, steady climb towards USD1M ib 2032. Maybe the predictions are overly conservative for some people. I doubt we will see a USD1M price level during the 2024-2025 bull market so the hopium crowd should relax.
I'll sell some when we surpass golds marketcap.

That's my fair value target
We hope to hit 50k by weekend.
$50k and back to $40k by the weekend.
My conviction isn't in Bitcoin.

My conviction is in the inevitable collapse of fiat.

My conviction is in the fact that we will never use gold/silver as money in a digital world, and that any attempt to "back dollars with gold" will fail over and over again.

Bitcoin could work.  No conviction here.  But I'm convicted that Bitcoin is the only thing that "might" actually work.  There is no second best asset.  Real Estate, stocks, bonds....  all are disappointing, centralized, fiat-based games of chance.  So, let's see if Bitcoin can finally offer true scarcity to a world that desperately needs it.
True hopium pulsing through this guys veins.
But you were not "convicted" but convinced that bitcoin is the only thing that might actually work. Thanks
I started there but the more I learn about the actual protocol, nuts and bolts shit, the more I actually believe Bitcoin is it. Fiat is fucked, no question but I think this system really is immutable and fully capable.
Funny how fast we all wish we bought more. Lol.
I don't have more money to buy
I'm officially up on all buys now, yay!
A family member listened to me when it dropped to around 28-32 range. I’m a hero right now to them haha congrats to everyone!
Like after the 32k short squeeze, Jamie diamond will again return to Congress to say if he controlled everything he would ban Bitcoin.
Sell?
Bought $100 worth before this spike. 

Winning is an understatement
Fuck off... I DCA every week. Every Tuesday. And it always feels like this is the highest point of the week. And of course I always DCA at the highest daily price.
It's still early .... if it's it's high of 66 and maybe hits close to $100 
It may have some promise
$100,000 end of year let's go 🚀
Look at the chart, 48000 retest then fail imo.  Too soon for another run.
InshaAllah profits
Everyone who bought at 50k will sell to cover years of losses
Why would anyone wait two years to recover and then sell? Now at $100k there will probably be some selling pressure.
Come on, $4k!
FuckinAright!
Hell yeah!
This is gentleman
I’m glad I can stand with you guys one dollar at a time! 🫡🤑
I feel sad, it might be our last time seeing 45k. Goodbyes are tough. Sorry bears.
In the digital world there are only three things to do
And the rocket is off!
May we never see <44k again!
Bitcoin waits for no one.

That said I hope you catch that dip!
Coz its gonna rip...
This guy
lol yeah I’ve been abroad for a month and wanting to add this month’s funds. When I do, my account gets frozen (even though the bank know I’m abroad)
fuck off
And a happy new year to you kind ser.
Even 2032 would be somewhat aggressive. We're starting to max out and smooth the curve -- $1m by 2038. 

Source: none.
What is gold's marketcap?
Almost $14 trillion.


1 btc would be around $700k
40k is something from the past... Its not hapening again
Where were you in 2021
The major concern i have is quantum computing and what affect that may have especially if it’s capabilities are not publicly known.
Nothing. BTC will fork way before a threat like that could jeopardise the network.
Cross that bridge when that happens. But for now, shut up and stack sats
Same. Dca is my way. See you all next next halving maybe before I can even take profit 😂
Because people felt burned and said they will get out of it when they break even again.
And then they will see it continue to climb and will buy back in higher.
And after selling to break even they will buy again at the next ATH. Gotta love those people.
Those are losers, not investors. They will lose regardless of where they put their money. I don't think there are as many losers in Bitcoin as are in other investments.
700K at today’s money. 

Probably a lot more in 10 years time if BTC hits gold’s market cap. A realistic expectation (at gold’s market cap) is $1M.

Still not enough to buy a house though…
Yup they miss the gains and then fomo in during the next top. rinse and repeat.

It's 150,000 sats to the wallet of your choice if you're closest without going over! How high does Bitcoin go during Calendar Year 2024?  Your prediction must be an EXACT amount of US Dollars, only 1 prediction per user.

High during 2023 = $44,705.

Closest prediction was $44,690, made by u/TheHoodOG .

Good luck!!!

EDIT:  So everyone is aware, the final high price for Bitcoin, is found using Yahoo Finance's web site.  $420,069🚀🚀🚀
God I hope. 🤞🏼
$89,500

I am from the future.
My prediction is actually right around this as well. I had $35k in mind for 2023 though. So I must be a conservative forecaster. I'll double yours and say $179,000 just to account for my conservatism in 2023.

I’m being deliberately negative as I’m usually really wrong on these things. Reverse psychology 101…

I do think the $75-$90 range is correct, but there are a lot of guesses around there.  I do remember $10,000 was expected to be resistance and it was not.  I say ETF inflows go nuts and Bitcoin slices through $100,000 to $114,069
