Bitcoin price crab walking, but Bitcoin related stocks (Mstr, Coin, Riot, Mara) going up today. I wonder if there's some early inside news on ETF approval, and insiders are buying stock because it's what they're used to.
[https://twitter.com/BTC\_Archive](https://twitter.com/btc_archive)

[https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine](https://twitter.com/bitcoinmagazine)

I want to be careful optimistic, to me it sounds like ETF approval is done deal in january.
*Stay stacking, my friends*
How do you feel about Microstrategy as a long Bitcoin play?
I used to hold it in my IRA because I planned on using it to take profits when bitcoin goes up. I ended up giving up on it. If I was going to hold it now, I think I'd be hesitant. If and when the ETFs are approved, I do think that'll mess with Microstrategy's stock price. On the plus side, as people look to gain exposure to bitcoin > Money will move into the ETFs > Bitcoin go up > Microstrategy will go up(even as money might shift away from it to the ETFs. 

I think opinions will vary. The main thing would be just to hold bitcoin. On this subject, I had started a position in Block for this reason when it was around 90-100... ended up selling when it dropped to 80 for a small loss. I got back in when it dropped to the 40s. 

Block is one thing with bitcoin but they have been growing all of their financial services over the years. There's so much more there(in my opinion) than Microstrategy. I like the way they handle bitcoin(with buys/sells). I hold most equities with Fidelity but I even started positions in varying growth stocks over on CashApp.
üé∂ *I can feel it coming in the air tonight* üéµ
Oh lord
If bitcoin goes way up in price after the ETF announcement will anybody here consider to start buying the ETF?
In my IRA absolutely
I'll buy the ETF when chicks stop wearing the wedgy pants at the gym.
In my IRA... it's a no-brainer. 

Will I sell any of my stack to convert to an ETF... hell to the nah!
I would consider the ETF for estate purposes.
Why, when you can hold the real thing?
Just sold some of my IRA holdings (just $10k) so I have settled funds ready for the ETF when it becomes available.  Looking forward to turning $10k into $100k tax-free!
i'm not sure you'll be able to get bitcoin as low as $43K once all ETFs are operational, but good luck!
UK users

Is there anyway we can get some exposure through our employment pensions?
No but the closest is MSTR microstrategy stock, or wait for the bitcoin ETFs (watch out for fees). The UK government has banned pensions in crypto so it's not clear if the ETFs will be allowed.
Just buy MSTR. Trades on a premium to the underlying bitcoin but it's close enough. You can also buy miners, which trade at a ridiculous multiple to BTC price movements. You can also put MSTR in your ISA, which means no capital gains if you ever decide to sell.
Question - what is best way to buy larger qty of sats non kyc for transfer to cold wallet account?
If you know someone who owns Bitcoin, they might be willing to sell you some. I'm sure there are other ways, but that's the simplest.
BTC going crazy now.
Argentina Approves Bitcoin (BTC) as "Official" Currency - Google is your friend
For contracts only. 

>Argentina‚Äôs new government has ‚Äúratified and confirmed‚Äù that contracts denominate in Bitcoin can be officially recognized by the country‚Äôs courts

>The historic tweet also emphasizes the broader acceptance of various cryptocurrencies and even other commodities like kilograms of beef or liters of milk, as per existing law
Massively misleading.
Does anyone worry about owning KYC bitcoin? I bought my stack on Coinbase, and although it's in cold storage and I never intend to sell I worry about one day being hit with a specific bitcoiner tax. The 'tragic boating accident' excuse doesn't work when the authorities can see your coins move.
Why? To max out your registered accounts.
What does this mean?
Yes, I agree with that but if you read my question, I was asking if the price goes extremely high and fees, go extremely high would you consider the ETF.
Why though?
Again, no. Regardless of price, I‚Äôll hold the real thing thanks.
the ETF will also have to charge those fees. They might not be as transparent, but they're definitely not going to be generously covering those fees for buyers.
What do you mean?  I wasn‚Äôt thinking it would be at $43k.  I already own BTC but want to put $10k into the ETFs once they‚Äôre approved and available.
i'm not from USA but my guess is ETFs will get approved and there's gonna be a period of a few days until you can actually buy it, but in that "in-between" period bitcoin could go parabolic upwards 

but great you already own it and you'll just be adding more üëç
Tax advantaged accounts (IRA/401k)
Oh, yank stuff. My bad
Look at how scarce Bitcoin is and its about to get even more scarce in 2024!As of today, it looks like there are only 1,822,809.97 bitcoins remaining on exchanges.

The rest are stored in cold storage. These are typically people who are not thinking of selling in the short to medium term.

Some are on exchanges but are lost forever.

Some are on exchanges but owned by Spot ETF's like Fidelity (Yes Spot ETFs because they are already approved in Canada. Just one of Fidelity's spot ETF holds  **3223.4255** bitcoins on exchanges.)

now consider all the people that DCA'ing all over the world everyday in small amounts. This means each day 1000's of bitcoins are being bought up and that overall Bitcoin on exchange number is potentially reducing as a portion of these people move to cold storage periodically.

Now consider when Spot ETF's in the USA get's approved and the halving happens.

100k/Bitcoin is just the tip of the iceberg and as they say, holding even .01 BTC (1,000,000 SATS) is going to be significant.

Bitcoin is not even 1 Trillion in Market Cap yet. Gold on the other hand is 13 Trillion

Gold is just a shiny rock that is scarce and allows for store of value. Bitcoin is a digital version that does the same thing with better properties (More divisible, Easier to transfer etc.). The younger generations are not talking about gold, they are talking about crypto and bitcoin.

Not financial advice. Do your own research and invest responsibly but I would recommend getting as much BTC as possible before its' too late.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;while I agree that there will be a supply shock followed shortly by a 'god candle' at some point, I think most the analysis around 'only X BTC left on exchanges' is super shallow. People move coins back onto exchanges and sell them. That's how markets work. If the price rises significantly, more people will be willing to sell. 

I would be considered a maxi by most, but if 1/5 of my stack can buy a nice house in 10 years or whatever... I'm probably gonna sell 1/5 of my stack.
When considering the future scarcity of BTC, my view is different. I agree that BTC will be scarce compared to other coins, but I believe there will always be enough BTC on exchanges for buying and trading. As it becomes scarcer, demand and price will increase, leading to more people selling and cashing out profits. Do you think this could be the story of BTC for the future?
There will come a point in time, sooner than most people think, that fiat will lose value so fast, NOBODY will want to convert.  This usually happens when inflation goes over 20%.
Everything you said is fair. People definitely move coins back on exchanges to sell. That's why I said "generally" those who move to cold storage are not thinking selling in the short or mid term.
I am hoping that I will never have to trade my btc for dirty fiat. Which would trrigger a tax event. It would br good to use say 10 to 20% of ones sats stash for a (self-custodied) collateral loan, to borrow for a house. Using a tried and true smart contract that is.

Do you think this is likely and possible, or am I dreaming?
I did read something the other day though that was interesting. Basically saying an estimated how ever many million tokens are lost in accounts where people either are unable to recover seed phrases. Or passed away without leaving information to loved ones so they can recover account.
The amount on exchanges may be fairly low, but we have to take into account the amount that are available from miners also.  Until the miners run out of supply for the big fish, the price swings from exchange trading may not be that outrageous.  Also, as the price goes up, some people send it back to an exchange to liquidate in order to by other assets (land, houses, stonks).  If ETF's get approved and the price goes to .5 Mill, people will liquidate it and buy stuff.  I have a feeling those of us who are holding till it becomes a hyper bitcoinization situation, are few.
How do the exchanges work out how much bitcoin to have on hand? Will there be a situation with how much bitcoin is traded on exchanges vs how much there actually is to trade? How does that work?
What do u mean by "some are on exchanges but are lost 4ever?"

I agree on various points here but me as a millennial, I do love me some gold and silver too. I enjoy everything about precious metals, from the looks and touch I instantly fell in love with PM‚Äôs.
Ya i hold a bit of Gold too but I'm way more bullish on Bitcoin!
This feels like such a 'kids onWSB' take. Please continue, I like how fucking rich this kind of thinking is making me.
I don‚Äôt really understand what makes bitcoin an asset. The fact that it‚Äôs a good currency system that is scarce? Does its volatility not have any negative impact on it as a currency? Like I just don‚Äôt get why anyone would want to hold bitcoin for its actual purpose considering its value just swings up and down 24/7
Its a store of value. Your point about price volatility is fair but that's only because the market cap is relatively low. Look at gold, it does not fluctuate as much because its Market Cap is huge. Bitcoin market cap is growing and once ETF's hit, it's going to get even more stable as a store of value just like Gold. It does not have to be currency! Do I buy bread with gold (No!) I use gold as a store of value. Its a shiny rock that we as humans gave value to. Bitcoin is going through the same transformation. There is a reason why the biggest asset manager in the world (BlackRock and Fidelity) is doing all this work to get an ETF.
>I don‚Äôt really understand what makes bitcoin an asset. The fact that it‚Äôs a good currency system that is scarce?

Technically, Bitcoin isn‚Äôt currency. It‚Äôs money, there is a difference between the two, but to keep things simple, money can also be used as a currency. 

What gives Bitcoin value is it‚Äôs the first asset (*or property*) that cannot be spoofed, forged, duplicated or mass produced to create more units. Unlike traditional assets, currency or property.

&#x200B;

>Does its volatility not have any negative impact on it as a currency?

Sure, but all currencies have volatility, at one point in time ¬£1 GBP could buy $2 USD, which was good for one side of the currency, and less so for the other. Currencies float and gain and lose strength all the time, but again there‚Äôs differences between traditional currencies and Bitcoin used as a currency. Fundamentally, limited vs unlimited supply.

&#x200B;

>Like I just don‚Äôt get why anyone would want to hold bitcoin for its actual purpose considering its value just swings up and down 24/7

Tell me, what is Bitcoin‚Äôs actual purpose? Because it‚Äôs likely that you and I have different understandings to what Bitcoin‚Äôs purpose is to us, for you it might be about closing a futures trade in the green, for me it could be about savings for a house, now multiply those opinions by billions and billions of independent individuals, companies and organisations, mix in a little free market and well some will hold through 70% dips üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è and others won‚Äôt, some will spend all day on buttcoin bashing Bitcoin, others will do the research. Meanwhile, tick-tock next block is mined and the chain continues.

Be curious, continue to ask questions, understand what money is, and isn‚Äôt, the more you question the more you‚Äôll learn. The Bitcoin Standard by Saifedean Ammous is a fantastic starting point if you haven‚Äôt read it already.
IF enough people believe it has value (like gold, silver, etc.), then it becomes a valuable cash store. Albeit a more volatile alternative.
People realized governments be bitches printing trash calling it money's.
It's scarce and desirable.  So it's an asset.  You really want to know why it's desirable.  

It's desirable because satoshis can't be copied, are secure, fungible,  and digitally transferable to anywhere on the planet that has internet.
Why wouldn't you want to hold it? Bitcoin is the people's money. It is made for you to escape the system. You don't have to participate if you don't want to though. 

Also, volatility is just an illusion. If you are a trader, then yes it is volatile. But zoom out. It's not volatile at all. It just goes up, and will continue to do so forever.
People see value. Its just a fact. Why old paintings have value
Is there a value proposition to a transaction ledger? Is there a value proposition to a balance ledger?

Your money and stocks are stored on ledgers. These ledgers need to be airtight and secure and trustworthy. Bitcoin is a globally distributed transaction ledger than anyone can use. It is not controlled by a single nation state. Like the internet. It's the first global transaction ledger not tied to the wills of a nation.

Your dollar is a number in a balance ledger somewhere at a bank. That's all money is in the end. The ledger. Bitcoins ledger is the most robust and airtight transaction ledger made to date. Bitcoin is what the power loom was to seamstresses but to banks instead.
Bitcoin's security model is unsustainable. Hodlers don't pay jack shit to secure the network. What pays for the network security are the transaction fees and the inflation built into Bitcoin currently. That inflation / Bitcoin block rewards are set to significantly be diminished over the next 20 years. Bitcoin has to get to more than $2.6 mil per BTC by 2044 just to maintain the current security budget after adjusting for inflation. 

Ultimately one of two things will have to happen, people need to transact on Bitcoin network constantly, or the Bitcoin maximum will have to be lifted for a constant set inflation rate. 

Otherwise Bitcoin will fail.
Im pretty sure the bitcoin network is rock solid. I dont know the specifics behind it but an attack would involve becoming the major mining operator in the world. Which would cost trillions......then BTC would be worth zero, and you'd lose another few trillion.
What about changing the consensus mechanism eventually. By doing this the security model problem could be addressed
I disagree about gold being shiny. Shit is kinda ugly until its refined and polished.
BTC does incredible volume, meaning it's plenty liquid.
No, it wont be more scarce.  It'll be less scarce, in fact. 

The rate of supply growth decreases, but supply is still growing.
You should be looking at my foot, as it's currently heading for your ass
If it is scarce, what does that do to liquidity?
Bitcoin. Never bitcoin(s) or salmon(s).
What is the inflation rate in the US today? Where was it a year ago?
I reckon it was double figures easily, even though they try to claim that it was like 8-9% or something (or at least thats the case in UK)
I use cold storage for security.  Even if i wanted to sell in less than a year, I'd still use cold storage.  Exchange failures seem to happen in minuets.  The amount of time it takes to transfer to an exchange and hit the sell button is a lot less time than letting it sit there for 6 months.  Some may be willing to accept that risk... not I.
There are 2 certainties in life: Death and Taxes. I do like your idea though, but they'll get their share one way or another.
Will the ETF allow shorting more easily?

Why i love bitcoinI am from Southeast Europe, the country of the former Yugoslavia

I am 50 years old

30 years ago, a civil war broke out in my country It was a happy communist country

No one could imagine that such a war would happen

people lost all their real estate, their gold and gold jewelry were stolen by various gangs and armies

Before the war, my father worked in Switzerland, he kept his savings of 200,000 Swiss francs in Yugoslav banks.

But the banks failed

You couldn't take your savings

Imagine you have 200,000 Swiss notes in your account, but you are hungry

you lost your house, jewelry

you have nothing

The money that the government printed and distributed as aid was worth nothing because of hyperinflation

With bitcoin you can escape to the other side of the world if there are problems in your country and carry your savings in your head and start a new life

bitcoin will save the suffering many people around the world

Thank you SatoshiIm with you. Ignore the Buttcoin addicts.
is buttcoin a real coin?
how are you with him? you don't even know how it is to experience such a thing as an civil war!
My grandparents were farmers in Zimbabwe. They had saved their pension in Zimbabwean banks. The currency hyperinflated. Imagine working and saving your whole life and dying as poor as a church mouse because of corrupt and incompetent bankers. This is why I believe in Bitcoin.
The bankers weren't incompetent, they were corrupt.
Yep. So fkin disgusting, it's hard to put into words.
And you think your grandparents got that land by being genuine?
Your experience shows the value of Bitcoin in difficult times. It can be similar to a savior for those facing difficulty.

No. Just no. You may have been happy, but an overwhelming majority most definitely wasn't.

\> No one could imagine that such a war would happen

You must have \*really\* lived in a bubble! The weird thing about Yugoslavia wasn't the war, but the fact that they had 40 years without a war for probably the first time in their history.

No one with the least bit of historical knowledge was surprised when war broke out.

Most people lived in happiness  
No hungry and homeless people  
All of them had their own private property houses or received free apartments from the government  
Everyone had a job  
People could go to the west of Europe and do whatever they wanted to earn more, but they all returned to the country.  
The banks were communist states, you could take a loan for free and never pay the bank back  
Communists did not propagate a consumer society  
There were no different goods to buy and no big shopping centers  
But people went to nearby Trieste in Italy or Graz in Austria for tourist shopping tours  
You could listen to Western music, Hollywood films and series were broadcast on communist TV  
You could have your own private business restaurant, cafe,  
video clubs for renting VHS tapes with Hollywood movies, and various other small businesses  
If you look at the situation in those areas today, it was a happy time
Before I go on, are you from Yugoslavia or did you live there or know people who did?
Ofc he wasa happy communist with 200k swiss franks.
I remember the time, majority was pretty happy.
Unless you lived through it, those are some awfully bold statements to be making to the OP who actually did live it.
There's a reason eastern european boomers want to go back to communism. The early 90s were a nightmare for them as the state was sold off to private entities.

Was with you up until ‚Äúhappy communist country.‚Äù
Yeah, you can't really say it was "happy" if people were willing to start a civil war...
You have to know the actual situation and compare to that communist country it was. Am not pro communist but it was way better before the fck serbia started wars and trying to invade every ballkan country after yougoslavia falls.
He probably meant it was a happy communist country for a while on a surface level if you didn't inspect too much.

But obviously behind the screen everything was deteriorating and once the screen was pulled back everything fell apart and people were murdered.
It's OP's experience, not yours, and it has nothing to do with the point of the post.
it's a hypothetical insurance, a crisis hedge, and yet people are like nope it sucks, don't need it, what's the point
it was not civil but ethnic war, a war between historically and biologically separate nations.

and jugoslavija was a classic communist hell, terribly unhappy and aggressively restrictive regime for all but the upper class.

sorry but i cannot ignore historical fact mischief.

but yes, it is a great economic example of why btc is superior to government-printed money. btc knows no boundaries between states and nations :)
Yes correct the guy that actually lived there
Yugoslavia was a communist country, but far from Soviet repressive communismPeople could work and travel to the west, they were freeThey could accumulate capital, have private businesses such as restaurants, butchers, cafes and other small businesses.It was a bad regime for the Croatian fascists and nationalists because the secret services persecuted them, but for the rest of the people it was a happy country.
Moj brat!
Wake up, man. Civil war does not start because the country was "happy". That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
It was happy for some people, and for others not so much. In a way, we never moved on from communism.
Imagine getting your bitcoin account hacked and coins stolen, and no way to recover those lost coins, because customer support is non-existent, it's technically infeasible to do so, and the market is grossly unregulated thus fewer consumer protections, now imagine trying to access your account that you're locked out of, and customer support is virtually non-existent, or criminally slow to remediate your issue, at many crypto exchanges.

There are pros and cons to everything my friend.

But yes, bitcoin will fare better, and may even outperform a struggling stock market.

1. Durability
2. Portability
3. Divisibility
4. Uniformity
5. No counterfeits
6. Limited supply
7. Acceptability

It seems as though you've confused "**currency**" with "**money**". The derivative is never worth more than the underlying asset. In the digital world, there is only one underlying asset. One money. Best of luck with your currencies though.
wait arent you from africa?
Thank you for sharing your experience with us üëç
This guy is braining.
Right but you still have to escape somehow. 

But yes I agree. 

A safe in your mind.
pfft, this can't happen anymore.  My real estate holdings in Gaza will always hold value.  They're not making any new land anymore.
Can bitcoin be stolen from you?
First your father loses all his money.

Then you lose all your money: "I'm from Africa and I lost everything overnight due to hyperinflation  
usd has less inflation and many people see it as a safe haven  
but in some countries you can't buy a dollar because the exchange offices don't want to sell the dollar  
BTC is a much better currency"

Then you lose everything again, by having your btc in Celsius.

When will you learn? I am not talking only about having "." at the end of your sentences.
As good as gold, or better
Bitcoin is the biggest fuck you to thieves, dictators, bankers, politicians, militia etc.

Basically a fuck you to anyone who at some point could try to take your wealth in some way.
‚Äúhappy communist‚Äù -> ‚Äúa civil war broke out‚Äù
Yes thank you Satoshi's.

Thank you Jesus for Satoshi
I haven‚Äôt ever experienced a civil war either. I‚Äôm also with him
A civil war i have'nt experienced. I'm with him also.üòÅ
That‚Äôs a presumptive statement, didn‚Äôt realise you knew my history‚Ä¶
I actually spent a significant amount of time outside of my home country Krakozia due to a civil war outbreak in 2004.
Did you get stuck in an airport too üòâ
I‚Äôve seen Captain America: Civil War, and I, too, am with him.
Competently corrupt
‚ÄúThey weren‚Äôt being stupid, they just didn‚Äôt care‚Äù
Its a complex topic. 
but you can see an arguement for both sides why self sovereignty of your assets are important for wealth preservation.

Did you just described USA?
isn't that ironic!
Bro, wake up!  


You are obviously not describing the true situation. If people were willing to fight, die, and start a civil war, then that necessarily means the country wasn't "happy".  


You think people went around and said, "Man, life is good here. Let's buy some weapons and kill the people we disagree with"?
Ignore the Americans, many of them have been influenced by McCarthyism, their view of communism is fundamentally tainted by that and their historical rivalry with urss. I am still skeptical about your view towards it not gonna lie, because if everyone was happy then no one would have changed it, but it is of more value than someone who never lived under it at all.
My parents escaped communism and that country is horrible, people starving and sugar with water for breakfast. You don‚Äôt know how its to live in such places. They have ‚Äúfree healthcare ‚Äú yet family is constantly sending back basic childrens meds like tylenol. When you lived in those places you would know. People dont risk their lives trying to escape for no reason.
If they had "free stuff" as in free beer, they were not free as in freedom.
It's good that the war broke out and put an end to that commie slavery.
the way americans have the freedom to choose between 50 different kinds of cereal?
For employment/industry, they also had an export oriented auto industry.  Low cost of living allowed a lot of vacation time, and vacation properties.
If there was private business there, then there was no communism there.  Well, you can call the countries whatever you want.  For example, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. It doesn't matter in this case.
No, no, yes.
Everywhere anytime there is someone willing to start a civil war... Not everyone agrees with everything all the time and there are always extremism, and don't forget the role Nato and cia had in breaking appart Yugoslavia, sprinkle in some nationalism prime and there you go, a civil war, even if overall people might have been happy
Seems like OP‚Äôs family was fairly well off if they had a savings of 200k+ in SF, especially during the 80s/90s. I‚Äôm sure he did live a comfortable happy life and was exposed to people of his socioeconomic class-even in a communist country.
His/her username suggests Croatia, so they should know a thing or two about that conflict too
I too like to correct people about the area they were literally born and raised in.
Here's another one that hasn't read the whitepaper, you would prolly have lectured satoshi himself on what he was doing.

Since you are never gonna read it, he calls it himself currency, and in the very first page he uses the word "cost" 4 times, without considering the other pages. 

Gj dude, nice imagination btw
Oh - so you're admitting you don't understand the *sly* purpose of that term? Well this is awkward... I guess you've *only* read the whitepaper and not everything else ;)  
Have you read all the references in the whitepaper? Or other books, studies, Austrian economics etc etc..

In other words, you don't understand Bitcoins DUAL purpose because it's the only network that does all 7 characteristics and 3 properties perfectly. I dare you to name another?

Regardless, I can destroy you in a few words:

* Layer 1: Money - Bitcoin.
* Layer 2: Currency - Lightning Network.

This is the funny part about your reply; you seem completely oblivious to the fact that Bitcoin is money AND currency yet you're attempting to lecture otherwise. If you read my comment, you'll find I never argued it's not a currency... I implied it's not *purely* one or the other.

Again, read the references. Again, I dare you to name another? No? Just currencies? Financial services? I thought so. If a currency fails, money doesn't care. If money fails... yeah, *"dude".*

You're a spectator in this industry for 3 years.  
I'm BUIDLing blockchain projects for 8 years.  
We are not the same. 

You've a lot more reading to do than me but *"nice imagination btw"*
I waited, because I had to wait, I made a friend called Gupta though who helped me get through it üòÖ
Eeeeeend anada van
We're talking about Yugoslavia. There was never starvation or lack of basic medicine there.
Watch this documentary in English about life in Yugoslavia

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waEYQ46gH08
No. The way Americans have the freedom to become a cereal manufacturer and sell their products without the threat of being thrown into a cage for doing so.
Love this reply
From the same brand xD
Well when you live in the same country, you don't necessarily agree with everyone of your compatriots.
And Croatia was Yugoslavia too, so they were both Yugoslavian. By your logic we shouldn't question anything people say if they are from the same country we are.
splinternista: Hey so I grew up in the war here and....

reddit: pfff STFU we'll **tell you** what you're supposed to think about your own life fewl
Born and raised somewhere = history expert  /s
redditors: the sole deciders if someone **elses** life story is valid or not.

not /s
Lightning network wasn't even a thing in that day, quoting posthumous works to answer to a document that has never been changed shows how much you are smart.
And if not by that, by expecting to know the background of someone and their knowledge of the matter by his activity on reddit you show it again. If i were to use that same way of thinking with you you'd be 34 days old in the space.

And actually you're the one lecturing others on the definitions of money and currency, a thing that no one asked for, while also putting in a ton of buzzwords, and managed to contradict yourself in the span of 2 comments. I quoted the document to actually show that he used both and you're just splitting hairs all by yourself. Congratulations on the 8 years, noob
*In that day.*.. yeah neither was large fees :) hence the upgradability feature

I know what I know because you admitted to being a noob 3 years ago on your account. Please show the contradiction? What exactly was a buzzword? Do you not have any courage to back your logic like I did? Or are you continuing to make assumptions so I can correct you some more?

A whole lot of words saying nothing \^\_\^

*edit: lol I just seen you post on NANO community and I worked on that project for Colin LeMahieu. Although it was RaiBlocks when I started. Send him a DM there and ask him does he like the Guinness in the Ferryman on the keys in Dublin. You've no clue who you're "lecturing" lol. Crypto is a small enough BUIDL community, my dear spectator :) but thank you for buying our product!*
