It is also Proof of Keys day. Time to pull any remaining sats from exchanges to keep them honest.
15 years strong 💪
How does the Spot Bitcoin ETF increase bitcoin’s price & supply? (Im new, sorry)  My assumption is that for every 45k purchased into the ETF, Blackrock needs to have 1 bitcoin?

Or did they prepurchase $XXX million in bitcoins and the ETF will simply track the price? (Likely $45 a share rather than 45k/share)
Mix of the two. They would buy low to anticipate demand.


Let's go crazy and assume 1 trilly gets bought up. They would have to purchase the difference, and one assumes immediately. 

It's a huge year. If bitcoin does not reach ath this year then it will call into question whether or not the halving or etfs really make a difference or is it all market manipulation
> My assumption is that for every 45k purchased into the ETF, Blackrock needs to have 1 bitcoin?

For every bitcoin purchased in the ETF, Blackrock needs to have one bitcoin.
Spot ETF increase price of bitcoin because it will be easy method for large US institutions to buy bitcoin. Investors buy ETF and ETF buys and holds the real BTC for the ETF. This means more demand for limited amount of bitcoins in the world.

Supply of bitcoin is hard capped and spot ETF does not change or affect that.

When can we expect to get a ruling from the SEC?
The only thing we know for sure is it didn’t come yesterday
Jan 10th is response deadline for Ark ETF. Some expect a bunch to be ruled on at once.
Oh wow, thanks for the response. I wonder if there will be a way to see how many they hold on their 13-F, or whatever their filings are named.

And I agree, if financial planners recommend just 1-2% allocation in these funds, we can expect serious growth and establishment. Especially if we rally and they share how well they did to their other rich folks.
Blackrock will be paying News & Social Media companies from now on to go all in, and advertise this shit out of their ETF's. Drawing in institutional investors who only know how to trade in stocks rather than educate themselves in how to buy Bitcoin & self custody. ETF's allow insitutional investors a way of investing in a landscape they understand. Meanwhile Blackrock will get rich on the fees for offering them that window.

Hopefully this will awaken mass curiousity into what Bitcoin IS and Does. More folks investing, joining Bitcoin reddit lol, getting stuck in.

Meanwhile, shitBanks will say their version CBDC is the best and safest etc. Saying we will need their digital ID, which will usher in a new form of digital slavery, with a social credit score attached. This will make Bitcoin even more valuable, due to it being decentralised (meaning no gov gets to control or program it) and more people adopting because they are seeking alternatives to the new CBDC nightmare.

Any way you look at it, bitcoin has multiple reasons to be valuable than not. Just adding some thoughts, enjoy
Sauce?
Michael Saylor to sell $216m of MicroStrategy stock, some of which will be used to "acquire additional bitcoin for his personal account"I’ll give him this….he’s not fucking around.
Forever Laura
He's going to take a bunch of coins off the market. Becoming a wholecoiner will one day be mythological.
I can’t wait for that…
I see that angle - 4800 coins of the 13,588,025 circulating supply. Dude grabbing another ~.054% of the total pie (as of today)
I think if a few ppl will own most of the btc! So how is that different when a big banks or big hedge funds owns most of the wealth?
I give it 8 years.
He’s either going to look like a genius or the biggest dolt in investing history.
MSTR stock is almost 700$ a share, outperforming what the vast majority of the market? I think it’s looking pretty good so far?
Rising tides raise all bo… fuck man I really hope he does it.
Go big or have fun staying poor.
He’s both
I miss sbf now 😅
He has been the longest CEO of a wall street company, he knows what he is doing, im selling my car tommorow morning to buy bitcoin
> im selling my car tommorow morning to buy bitcoin

Proof or ban
No he’s not
BASED
There is no second best.
Not enough scoffing.
Leave some for the rest of us
Bitwise will seed with 200M from an angel investor.... is Saylor the angel investor?
Interesting theory but why would he do that? 

MSTR has billions of dollars worth of bitcoin. Saylor has however many he has now. He'd much rather add to his stack than angel invest into a financial company for a product that will do well... but it won't do as well as holding your own.
Such a boss.
this is like the big short 2.0
Big long
quote in title taken from MSTR q4 conference call: https://twitter.com/BitDeez/status/1742312345899012106
Seems like there's something else going on here (not necessarily a bad thing). 

He could have easily gotten a loan against his stock.
He said in the conference call that 310,000 of these are options that were granted in 2014 that expire in April if not used. I believe the other 5,000 are more recently issued options.

It's not actually a sale of previously owned shares.
Lots of company big wigs have requirements to sell stock at certain times. This is likely the case. Look at 2022 when musk sold a bunch of tesla, it was part of his contract.
MSTR has been a way to gain exposure to Bitcoin through TradFi, which becomes unnecessary with Bitcoin ETFs
Hahahahahahahaha this guy is fucking IN!
If he's in, I'm in?

(can we use that here?)
He could be the next richest man in the world...
Currently, the richest single person on earth is recorded as Elon Musk at $250bn. This is disputed as the likes of Putin or those from royal families are probably richer, but we'll stick with Musk for now.

Saylor personally owns around 17,000 Bitcoin, tho that is likely out of date as it refers to a historical Tweet of his from a couple years ago.

Bitcoin needs to go to $14.7 million per coin, for Saylor's net worth from Bitcoin alone to exceeds Musk's.

That does not take into account any other assets Saylor has, notably his own MSTR stock, of which I believe he is majority shareholder.

If Bitcoin goes to $14.7m (not happening, certainly not in our lifetime) then obviously his MSTR stock will also appreciate.

But so will Musk's own net worth, as his own company's stock and personal assets will also appreciate.

So while it's cool to throw around statements such as 'Saylor will be the richest man ever!' (don't worry, you're not the first person on the internet to say that), it's actually extremely unlikely.
Rug the investors who invested in MSTR for Bitcoin to buy more Bitcoin. Those investors shoulda just bought Bitcoin instead. Lmaooooo
FOMO Mike
How many freaking shares they got lol
Michael saylor has 17,000 btc currently. MSTR has 200,000 btc
[deleted]
That much amount of btc, absolutely store it in cold wallet. I recently used Kraken and I like it. Might want to hear views from other people.
Get a trezor wallet immediately and ignore your DMs of people offering to help.  And don't tell reddit how many Bitcoin you have ever again for your own safety.
Buy bitcoin short Mstr when it pumps because grandpa will dilute
Idiot buying at the top lmao next bear cycle he’s going to cry
Hodl
The scarcity of BTC intensifies with each passing day.
He is fomoing into Bitcoin.
this guy
Bitcoin Gojira!
Well hey it's not fomo if sailor's doing it
Michael Saylor's Bitcoin strategy is going down as one of the best - or worst - investments of all time.
This is weird from an economical standpoint. MSTR should (and has been) outperforming BTC because it's a solid money-making business on top of a Bitcoin treasury.

Why would you want to exchange this for a (theoretically) worse-performing asset? Does he know something we don't? But that would qualify as insider trading. Is he planning a retirement and wants to decouple his portfolio from the company?
I keep seeing this comment. What's the story behind 'Forever Laura'?
https://youtu.be/zTPoRDrtc0s?si=IrTuQjoG9d41pvy6
An expression of Jack Mallers i believe
My thoughts exactly. As long as some whales (institutional or not) can significantly impact the market (make the price move at their will) BTC is in a bad place. And I don’t see that changing anytime soon.

That would make sense.
That's why they're called options.
They have requirements to not sell (lockups) not requirements to sell.
That's only on IPO's. Those are black out periods. Almost all publicity traded companies have executive stock ownership guidelines. Most are not made public, but the article below goes into some of that. It's not uncommon for executives to be restricted to holding a certain percentage of a companies stock. This means that when they get given stock as a bonus or pay. They are required to sell previously given stock to ensure equity balance. 

https://www.equilar.com/reports/34-executive-stock-ownership-guidelines.html
Well, MSTR has been flying despite people expecting the ETFs to go through at any moment now. So there are probably more reasons to buy it
Hey man. 2 BTC is a lot of money. Idk how much it is relative to your total wealth though. If it's significant enough to alter the course of your life and you don't even know what a cold wallet is, then you urgently need to learn the basics and how not to get scammed *now*.
Someone from Bitcoin customer support has probably already sent them a DM, should be sorted out soon.
Now my life makes more sense, thank you
Water? Like from the toilet?
Gotcha soz
Ownership guidelines refer to minimum holdings, not maximums. Read the article you linked to.
Finally got a “real” Bitcoin 😅😎There are actually some bitcoin available at auctions that have a seed phrase on them hidden under a hologram sticker. It's an actual bitcoin worth 1 bitcoin. And yes, they are legit
A buddy bought one back in 2013/2014. He confirmed it was legit (the public/private address line up and it has a balance on the block chain). But somebody had to fund that wallet and print the coin.

This was back when it wasn't all to valuable so maybe they didn't keep track, who knows.
Casascius
I remember saving these for sale, back in the day, for 50 dollars.

I thought it was a rip off because 1 BTC = $10 at the time, and I was poor

You win some you lose some lolol
Right, some guy from Salt Lake used to make them
Actually it contains the last characters of the public key on the surface and the private key underneath the tamper proof hologram. You reveal it by peeling it off
Lol and once they are sold the 1btc is immediately drained?
https://www.casascius.com
You would have to be naive to think it’s worth a bitcoin or some one is trying to scam
Happy cake! 🤘🏻🤘🏻
Haha! I have a few of those and give them out to people who don't understand bitcoin... It's fun!
Can I have one ?
What is this bitcoin thing?
Same here! 🤣
What’s bitcoin?
Who is Bitcoins CEO?
BiTTe-CoojjjjNn???? 😵‍💫🫠
Dam I can’t wait to start work so I can get more Bitcoin but I’m struggling to find a job 🙁
Hey start up an Amazon store where you can sell junk coins to people who like collecting junk!
Maybe you should post your videos on instagram reels for $$$ not on reddit for free
I still have 99 bitcoins somewhere sitting in my wallet.. no password, tho so.. I guess I was a millionaire in 2017
Whole coiner...nice.
I do kinda want an actual Casascius coin, but I can't justify the premium or the risk that it's been tampered with.
So much envy.
I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but if there's no yummy chocolate center under the foil, it may not be a real bitcoin.
You're right....I now have a broken tooth.... >,<
Where did you get this from?
Just off Amazon..10$ 😁
You would be better off buying sats.
looks like they already bought 100 million of em
Can’t hold sats my my hand though 😛
Who's going to tell him
Tell me........
If there are physical bitcoins that are worth 1 bitcoin then how does the blockchain account for that? Surely we can't have 21 million on the block and X amount of physical ones floating around, that would be over the hard limit of 21 million.
The OP's coin is a trinket, not even a collectible, low value. They were designed by Michael Bruce and mass manufactured in copper or silver. They're not Bitcoin. They're worth no more than the metal value  

There were only about 60,000 Casascius coins minted, with key hidden under a tamper-evident adhesive plastic. They're all on the blockchain  
https://casascius.uberbills.com/faq/
Fully agree- Hopefully you were able to buy it on the dip. Would hate to pay full price
I have the silver ones.
You had me in the first half not gonna lie
I need this in my collection, next to my Pokémon card
Is this like one actual bitcoin and how would you tell the fake and real how do you cash it if it’s a coin

Good thing it’s not a fake Bitcoin.
Yes keep it in the case and in a safe! I’ve been stacking em since 2017! Working on my second one!!!! 👊💪
Put the tab on dark mode you madlad
In 2017 I gave away 2.5 BTC in cas silver coins
2x  of the 1 BTC silvers ounce coins and a .5 silver

I keep telling the people I gave them to to have them appraised
Bro you gunna get hacked
If someone can hack me from this photo then heck they deserve the Bitcoin !
Is it a cold wallet with 1 btc in it?
Na this is just a souvenir from Amazon. I just held it up against my btc wallet 🙃
I would love to own something like that.

But I don't trust anybody, so I would want to buy the physical coin and engrave the seed/address myself and then seal it up.

I think it would be a neat thing to give my kids one day
Are those worth anything outside of the bitcoin value itself?
Ah this one was off Amazon … 10$ 😃
We use these in our home poker game. They’re a couple bucks each online and made in China.
Yeah , they have some nice weight too them
In 6 years these will cost 1M. 🙂

PD: happy cake to my self.
I didn’t know that the CEO of bitcoin still sent these out. Nice.
During the bull market in gold of the 1970s, the gold Krugerrand quickly became the primary choice for gold investors worldwide. wikipedia

https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Casascius_physical_bitcoins
I didn't ever see the coin, my friend lived in the UK at the time and myself in Canada.

He ended up gifting the 1 BTC coin to his 6 year old son in the US. That kid might end up alright!
Would still rather have 5 BTC than 1 Cassacius.
Yes, and the sticker is difficult to replicate increasing security
I was actually looking at an auction site a few months ago and the public key was posted and I checked it and it had 1 btc.
People who are looking to drain them aren’t they people who would pay the premium to buy them.  They are a historical artifact from the early days of bitcoin, and thus collectible.

They were created because people couldn ‘t wrap their heads around the idea of “money you can’t hold.”  So Casascius (Mike Caldwell) put a hologram private key on a coin and viola!
Not everyone on earth are assholes and scammers lol
Lol only if you drain it... Which you should
That was all the motivation I need
I post vids cause it’s fun to read comments when I’m faded 😂also I’m waiting for reddit to bring the contributor program to australia
Well i make approx $1000 a month on instagram posting similar videos for fun! Missing out dude!
23,623 Sats, surely?
No shit? Nice.  Bro riddle me this…..do you think that coin will actually be worth the same amount as BTC is right now? Like how we can buy actual silver and gold to barter with….you think that will happen with that coin?
Lol! this is just a cheap 10$ coin off Amazon in a display case....Just a physical representation of my "actual" Bitcoin.  Its got weight to it but I think its just some metal painted gold \^\_\^
Nope, but the person you bought this from sure can access that wallet address they put on that "physical bitcoin"

You should have bought a cold storage wallet, friend. Directly from the company might I add. Never through a third party.
Haaaaaa it’s just a coin. Has no other use other than being a coin that is displayed .
🤓
Such a lucky kid!
Definitely don’t ever buy this on an auction.  Here’s what  would happen.  They load the address with the 1BTC before the auction so you can confirm before you bid.  Then when you win the auction, they send you the “coin”, but not before transferring the BTC to another wallet using the private key, which they’ve already stolen from under the hologram.
Not everybody is out to get ya, easy cowboy.
U could check the history of the address, and you will get no money until that coin its on my private wallet
Dam bro good stuff. Instagram is way harder to gain interaction than reddit tho tbh
In other words.... it's useless.
The coin yes…. My Bitcoin … not so much 😋
But you're not going to brag about your BTC because it's not physical. 

🤦🏼‍♂️
Just a bit of fun mate… liven up a little 🥳
Yah you and 50 others posting "fun" but worthless info.... takes away the "liven up" mood every single day.
You don't have to comment the 50 post, just ignore it.
I think it’s cool just cuz you don’t doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be posted, your comments are even more worthless then this post, so what’s your point? Do you just spend all day telling people “HEY! I don’t like your post! Pssh!”
Wait… I’m confused. Doesn’t this actually have 1 btc on it? Or associated with it?
Let’s go 😂Only 4.7 million per btc? Bearish.
1 dollar per sat

Let pass the Apple first, K?
If it hit 100trllion i would be a billionaire. That would never happen but hey that’s funny
100 trillion market cap
You'd need ~200 BTC for that...
