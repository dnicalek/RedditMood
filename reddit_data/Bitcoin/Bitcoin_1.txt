The sub is what users make of it, so if you want to see good content here - be one of those who contribute it :)  

But yeah, BitcoinOp newsletters is just a packed dynamite of pure signal, they're doing an amazing job!

This is anecdotal, but over the past couple of weeks, it appears we're getting a lot more FUD posts than we've seen in a while. I started to check the users' profiles posting the FUD and noticed that most are active users but have never posted on Bitcoin before.  It's very strange, and it feels very fake.

I'm not sure what, if anything, this means, just an observation. It seems to be wasting a lot of people who want to help educates time.
It's going up forever Laura...
Would be nice to see a new yearly high today. Let's go!
I checked my crystal ball and I see that on 01/01/2024 Bitcoin will have a yearly high.

Edit: Checked again and yes, it still holds true. Thanks for the downvote. Your humor detector isn't working.
i had a dream last night bitcoin shot up to 120k. it has never been confirmed that i cannot see the future, buy now
Shit shit shit shit, I didn’t buy enough yet, SHIT
Why the volume all the sudden?
volume printer go brrrr
volumes gonna volume

ALL ABOARD THE SANTA RALLY 🎅🛷
first time in history retail can front-run the institutions
Salty buttcoiners will have some tough upcoming holidays.
Every high this year pushes straight into their butts
The \*claim\* they don't care when the price rises, because it makes them happy for the inevitable fall.

They're about see the price rise like never before in BTC history. I'm sure they'll claim tether is the reason or some other nonsense.

Oh well. It's funny to watch them squirm. They're the equivalent of a child plugging their ears and closing their eyes while screaming "I don't care!"
I took a skim, and it seems like most of the posts are about shitcoins now?
DCA'd some of my paycheck into BTC this morning. Something about stacking SATs is very satisfying
Agreed. It doesn’t matter if the price is up or down - your stack always goes up.
Seriously considering cashing out my IRA about 25k and taking the hit to buy in more. Holding 1.2 right now but the idea of getting right at 2 for etf approval and halving sounds fucking great!
Literally just buy GBTC with your IRA and watch it gap up at ETF approval… save it for tax free at retirement
do it!
Check out unchained to see if they can save you any taxes/penalties
I did it, took a 30% hit. 
Bitcoin made it back in 2 months!
Loaded up on miner stocks for some sweet high beta BTC exposure. Time will tell if this was capital allocation genius or an incredibly dumb move
Alarm bells go off for me every time someone uses the word "adoption".  Use of that word usually falls into one of two categories:

1) Someone saying that such and such is necessary for increased adoption.  The such and such is usually something unwanted, e.g. increased regulation.  My response to this is that bitcoin does not need adoption - it already works fine as it is - and that bad adoption is worse than no adoption.

2) A nocoiner saying that bitcoin will never be adopted because of whatever, e.g. price volatility (in fiat terms), transaction fees, etc.  An argument in this category is always a failure on the part of the nocoiner to understand bitcoin.
Bitcoin worked with just 2 people. But adoption is required IMO for this new asset class to truly propel.
maybe if we all go buy $20 worth then we can get it over the $45k hump
*Stay stacking, my friends*
price in 5-10 days, any predictions?
Corn UP!










.......or down.
Milli easy
$45k by Christmas
Tree fiddy
Stocks down, Bitcoin still up… oh yeah
...and while I'm here my fully degen uneducated punt is this shit is going to rip in short order, starting soon
Remember, it’s a sprint not a marathon
That's what she said.
What is causing the price to go up this morning?
Upward correction to its real value
I feel the need to say I really like Bitcoin. Anyhow, carry on
...oh, and I wish everyone the meyy of merry

...until next time
I’ve sent a transaction with electrum three days ago and it is still unconfirmed, tried bumping fee, but MB from tip is changing wildly, at some point it got to 9 MB but now i am down to 30 MB.

The transaction is slightly less than 0,008, fee is about 50 sat/byte

What are my options?
How long could it take to process my transaction?
Why did you choose 50 sats/byte?
I used to do loads of drugs and I'm wondering if I bought bitcoin.  What should I look for?  This was in the '60s.
are you saying you did so many drugs in the 60s you cant remember if you bought bitcoin in the 2000s?
I’m back after a 3 day suspension bitches!
[deleted]
Welcome back to the party pal! 🥳
Price just crashed by 1%
615 sat/vB fee…. When is it going to drop?
This is pretty frustrating
Try on Christmas Day. It should be much lower.
trezor fee for economy was 128 sat/vB few minutes ago
You're paying too much by wanting to be in the next block. Transactions of 100 sats/byte have cleared in the past 24 hours.  80 sats/byte in the last week.

But I'm sure the miners appreciate the subsidy.
Someone that breaths out of the top of their head eventually is going to say "OK that enough fun for you plebs, let's calm this down"

...but what happens when it doesn't calm down? For one I'd rather not have to breathe out of the top of my head
... the fuck are you talking about?
11:11. Btc to 46 today
Yeah we're calm! Very calm
Can we keep the value of bitcoin low please till after January 1st? I live in a country where we don't have capital gains tax but pay tax based on total value of possessions on 1st of January.
I made this prediction 4 days ago on this subreddit. Hold on to your butts - Prediction coming for today. Currently 10:44AM at the time of writing, check back later to see if I'm right. (I have been right the past 3 times I made these predictions, just never posted them so decided today was the day to see if I'm a prophet, and hopefully make you guys some profit, see what I did there? XD)  
Price will jump to around $43400 and then a quick spike above $44,000 potentially hitting this months highest level at around $44700 followed by around 10-30 minutes of trading sideways. Price will not drop below $44,000 until later in the day when it will drop by a SIGNIFICANT figure, potentially as low as $39,500. Price will correct by Monday to around $41500-$43000.   


and for the most part it was right, just the time scale was incorrect :D I still foresee this figures, just off by the timings. I'm scaling this up to happen within the next week.
Comment aged like milk, already. Anyway, no-one likes a braggart. So, lose-lose.
This guy referred to himself as a prophet. You sir, need a humble pie.
Are you this insufferable in all aspects of life?
go back to your bathhouse
Later on champions, my job is done here...see you on the high side
Oops, what happened...L ladder not working for you this time, shame
How small can btc  be divided?
100.000.000?

More or less 1c per sat?
Yes, one hundred million satoshis equals one bitcoin.  Bitcoins aren't really subdivided, though.  The satoshi is actually the only unit of measure in the bitcoin protocol.  It would be possible for a second layer such as Lightning to deal in fractions of a satoshi.

And yes, one satoshi would equal a penny ($US0.01) when the price of one bitcoin equals one million $US.
Someone certainly decided they needed a bunch of Bitcoin all the sudden.
Or dollars lol
These go to 11
I think there was a little Santa rally to close out the year back in 2021, so we'll need the same.
I’m considering doing the same, I know it goes against conventional thinking, and every advisor will advise you against it, but this could be a once in a lifetime opportunity to stack even more before the ETF.

My only concern is, and somebody might be able to set me straight, Europe already has an ETF and it’s launch did not affect price at all, and somebody posted that it’s been 48 days since anybody’s even purchased any of the ETF in Europe ?? 

Is this all pomp and no circumstance?
Regardless of the ETF approval halving is in April and if it follows pattern we should see at least 200% increase over the following several months.
Can you elaborate on this please?
You are correct.  Just as the phone works with 2 people, it has much more value and utility the more people that use it.  Same with the internet, which is why we can even discuss this.  Doesn’t do Bitcoin much good if the technology stays the same but people quit using it.
🎯
I respectfully disagree.  Bitcoin is already fine just the way it is.
Apparently looks like i didn’t have enough funds in my wallet “Could not find suitable outputs”

In the future i suppose i should check the going fee rate before sending
> In the future i suppose i should check the going fee rate before sending

An important lesson that all people who use bitcoin need to understand.  Blockchain space isn't free.  It's maintained and secured by millions of devices.
I intended the post as a joke, a parody of recent posts from people who supposedly can't remember whether or not they bought bitcoin.  But so far my post is at minus three karma.  So my dream of becoming a comedian remains elusive.
the bitcoin daily discussion might just be a tough crowd haha. godspeed jeff dunham
Snowflakes gonna snowflake
Trezor can say whatever they want but the only rate that matters is the actual rate, which is still around 600sat/byte.

128sat/byte is an estimate of theirs that they think it may drop to this level at some point, but it doesn't have to do so anytime soon.
Mempool.space shows 280 307 327 sat/byte for low medium and high so is that inaccurate?
Thanks for the information
Whales
Ah, gotcha 👍
Yep, it’s not even 3:00 and he was already way off. But he’ll see that and say he was only off by a little bit, feel like he was close enough to correct, but he’ll never be correct enough to have made money off the ordeal.
yeahh... nope. There's literally hundreds of future events I've forseen. Take the advice or not, my 75 million satoshi's don't care XD
are you this pedantic in real life? One person shows optimism for something they're passionate about and you have to shit on their face?
I don’t think pedantic means what you think it means
Or, maybe  there'll be a Satoshi market where fractions of Satoshis can be traded. Something like Lightening. We'll be hitting that problem next. It was interesting to see how the scaling problem was resolved. Now we have to prepare for the Satoshi problem.
lol true
\*taps mic\* is this thing on
No, that's accurate. It changes rapidly sometimes. Look back 5 or 6 blocks and you will see the rate was around 600
Alright thanks
You can check the going rate here:

Sorry ducking autocorrect Pathetic*
Will Bitcoin be in the top 5 next year?Only takes a USD valuation of $143,000 to break top 5. So, I would give it a pretty high probability.
I love the way you think
I reckon that figure is about right for the ATH next year (or 2025)
not quite, because by the time it reaches that, the top 5 will have increased as well
This chart means absolutely nothing and isn't even comparing apples to oranges.  Its comparing apples to windows.  Comparing a market cap to a countries M1 may have some correlation but this is absolutely useless.
But, but, hopium!
Can you elaborate?   A quick Google search indicates the following...

"M1 is the money supply that is composed of currency, demand deposits, other liquid deposits—which includes savings deposits. M1 includes the most liquid portions of the money supply because it contains currency and assets that either are or can be quickly converted to cash. However, "near money" and "near, near money," which fall under M2 and M3, cannot be converted to currency as quickly."

A country's M1 and bitcoin seems like a reasonable enough comparison to me.   The so-called "market cap" (a term stolen from the stock market which is supposed to represent the value of a company) of bitcoin could easily be thought of as the money supply of bitcoin.
lol wut?  We are comparing M1 to M1
Both are computers. Explain what you meeeeen man!
numbers go up
I wouldn't say it'a absolutely useless, because M1 is derived from M0 (physical paper and coin currency in circulation, plus bank reserves held by the central bank). I agree to your argument to a point that a more useful comparison would be to M0.
[I like this better](https://fiatmarketcap.com/)
Close I think- needs to roughly 4x in price which could happen.
Obviously it could happen. But will it? That's the question being asked. I don't think so. But stick your neck out and make a call.
Wrong question. It should be: Will the most inflated fiat currencies have fallen below bitcoin by end of next year (Switzerland is already out)?
🙌
Wait
Bitcoin is a country now?
Empire
In the top 3
Why is the European Union on here if its constituent countries also are?
I was going to ask too..
Should be just European Union, since the currency is used by many constituents.
This chart makes no sense. How come the Eurozone countries are separated when they use the same currency. Also, not every country in the European Union uses the Euro.
I would be happy with top 10 :)
Same here!
Dollar to Sat parity would make it #1
And transactions expensiveeeee
Bitcoin is M1 money supply? Lmao
Price of $500k puts it at gold's $11t market cap iirc so 2nd is quite possible imo. Basically $1m per coin puts it at number one convincingly.

This cycle is pretty hard to predict imo, liable to see bitcoin on exchanges empty and everyone with a net worth over $1m realise they've slept on the best trade the human species will ever see.
Love how Bitcoin-Believers will look at a chart that shows how Bitcoin is overvalued as fuck and see a Pro-Bitcoin argument lmao.
Got liquidated on your shorts hu?
Can you explain why do you think that Bitcoin is overvalued?
This chart is useless and doesn't show anything, let alone show that bitcoin is over-valued.
I don’t think you can accurately guess where it will be, and in what time frame. It’ll probably be number one for crypto for the next five years but, by year ten it may be worthless once a better store of value comes about that solves the problems it reintroduced - one that includes all the necessary infrastructure built around it as “solutions” to problems the current banking system already solved.
only if there us no other cryptos.  now bitcoin should bring in total or top 100 cryto categories
No
It never hit close to that it never go over 69 k share facts
I think it does at the peak of the bull of 2024 or 2025, or comes damn close. Definitely passes current no. 7 on this list (Italy) if all other numbers remain static
Right after Japan’s economy
Where did this stat come from? Just curious. I was gonna explore myself.
>I was gonna explore myself.

ahhh, the wonder years
Between Japan and Germany :D
I'm from the UK and the thought of BTC being worth more than my nation is awseome but terrifying
fiatmarketcap.com
Yes

O edit shoot I thought it said top 10

No not top 5
If anything, this ranking teaches me that Japan should stop the money printer.
It is valued in USD, so they would not increase their score by printing. But hey, Im not totally sure what we are looking at here.
Nope.
Bitcoin can’t be the only thing that would make this list, right? This is just comparing it’s capital with countries? Really just asking. Am dum. 

Reminds me of Dethklok being the seventh largest economy in the world.
and not even Blackrock is in the picture yet
2025 more likely.
Europe back to its medieval roots
Some of these posts make me think the top is in lol.
Are you seriously comparing market cap (last paid price x bitcoins in circulation) with actual cash? gtfo
Question, how is China 3rd when we owe them trillions in debt? How does this make sense? I don’t know much about this stuff, just a general observation and question knowing that we are in huge debt to them. The world is retarded
Depends on what kind of debt you’re talking about. If you’re talking treasury bills bonds and notes then they’re not even at 1 trillion.
I wonder where is my Brazil in this rank hahaha
In 5 years the chart will be denominated in $BTC.
us is above the entire eu 💀
Top 5 no, top 10 possible.  It needs to kick Canada off top 10, we do not deserve to be there.
End of 2024. Anyone who thinks otherwise hasn’t done the work.
Luxembourg is on top of any African nation .
Incredible.
I applied for a visa, gonna move there next year!
I don't know what that means.  You don't need hope to see that bitcoin is a one-way asset in the long term.  But bitcoins market cap also isn't 700B.  Its probably more like 400B due to lost coins.
Just a joke. I guess I forgot the /s
M1 is an outdated and now pretty useless measure of the money supply, it doesn’t include savings account balances
>A country's M1 and bitcoin seems like a reasonable enough comparison to me.   The so-called "market cap" (a term stolen from the stock market which is supposed to represent the value of a company) of bitcoin could easily be thought of as the money supply of bitcoin.

It SEEMs reasonable.  And my argument touches on a sore spot for many.  But bitcoin is not a currency.  It's not a viable currency.  Its not a "money supply".  I think it WAS a viable currency at one point.  Look at the example of gold/silver coins.  They were definitely a viable currency at one point.  You wouldn't spend a gold coin now, I don't think.  You'd save it, or sell it, or trade it for another asset.  So goes the way of bitcoin.  I believe the market has determined that bitcoin is not a currency, but a savings asset.  

Bitcoin acts much more like an asset/property than a currency.   So to compare it to the USA, it would be more viable to compare it to all financial/monetized assets (or asset classes) in the USA.  Which it has been countless times.  

I understand there are layer 2 solutions that are looking to make this possible.  And I think its a great idea.  Have at it.  But the *market demand for bitcoin as an asset will be much greater than the adoption rate of bitcoin as a currency.*  

Another problem I have with the market cap calculations is everyone assumes there are 19.5m coins in circulation.  There aren't.  Many have been lost forever, some estimates as high as 6million have been lost.  Meaning the viable market cap of bitcoin is more like 400B, not 700B.
Bitcoin is more of an asset that a currency at this point.  There may be a correlation to the increase in M1 vs bitcoin market cap, but they are not a linear correlation at all.  For every 1 dollar that goes into bitcoin, the market cap may rise anywhere from 1x to 130x, depending on where we are in the 4 year cycle.
It will happen. In a relatively short amount of time in the grand scheme of things.
Why not? What's going to stop it?
In cyberspace
Alright then. Germany, France, Spain etc etc don’t have their own currency so why are they there?
Yeah I rephrased, should be just EU, not individual countries using Euro.
At that point you would need to use a Layer 2 solution for small amount of sats. Maybe something like Fedimint or lightning?
Mate needs to part time behind Wendy's now
>It wasn't needed, really

Sorry, I'm not quick.
It wasn't needed, really.
With the chart the way it is displayed, it looks bearish as hell to me.  That's why I didn't get the comment.  I'd rather see bitcoins market cap compared to real estate, gold, SP500, to get a much more bullish outlook.
You already know it...We are so early!

The year of 2023 has been a true roller coaster. And 2024 is gearing up to be even more exciting. 

Big shout out to this community for your resilience and for sticking through the hard times.

During this holiday season, try to step back from the charts. Remember to breathe, enjoy the holidays, and touch some grass, even if it's covered by snow.

The world is slowly catching up to what we've known for a decade. The average Joe's perception of Bitcoin hasn't shifted much in years. Here's your reminder of it as an early Christmas gift haha: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/s/ss6PlFzmGQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/s/ss6PlFzmGQ)

Anywhoo, stay strong, keep up with your health because it comes before wealth, and enjoy the holiday season as we gear up for an exciting 2024!

&#x200B;

P.S.

Always remember to take profits along the way. We are all working hard to improve our lives and have some goals, whether buying a car or owning a house. Although luxury items may provide temporary happiness, it's important to keep in mind that true happiness comes from within. Don't get greedy! Also, if you have children, consider setting aside some satoshis for them to make their lives easier in the future. Peace!Yes I’m taking my profits from fiat by converting it to btc.
I’m with it!
Oof, reading that comment section thread’s conviction that Bitcoin is “magic money” or that it’s “too late” is just sad.

Bitcoin is open for ANYONE to participate in, yet, most sheep would rather be forced to live within a life shackling system - go figure 🤷‍♂️
Many people mistakenly think they require 1 BTC to own bitcoin. We can argue the ethics of holding multiple bitcoins, particuarly those with thousands of full bitcoins, but each person only needs a fraction of a bitcoin due to its scarcity. Until bitcoin is no longer tied to a fiat currency, it is easy to undestand their misconception about its future utility value in a bitcoin-only economy.

There will never be more than 21 million bitcoins in the entire world, solar system, or universe. Milliions of bitcoins have been lost (taken out of circulation) because the owners forgot their seed phrase. passphrase, password, etc. meaning real total gobal available inventory will never reach 21 million even after the final (near 21 millionth) bitcon has been mined. If bitcoin was equally distributed to every person, each person would have 0.002625 BTC in a world with approximately 8 billion humans. In other words, it is not too late to acquire fractional bitcoin but time is running out for a "affordable" 1 BTC for 90%+ of the population.

As a point of reference, if 1 BTC eventually reaches USD1M in value relative to the fiat system, a mere 0.01 BTC (1% of 1 BTC) will be worth USD10K (fiat equivalent). In a deflationary economy, that same 0.01 BTC might be equal to 10 BTC or maybe even 100 BTC in a fiat-based economy. We are conditioned to the fiat economy in which purchasing power decreases each time the government prints more fiat currency (inflation). For example, the US economy was booming during the 1950s while the cost of living was modest. A car and a house were affordable on the salary of one person in a family. Perhaps a bitcoin economy returns us to the same cost of living as the 1950s with the benefit of access to modern technology enjoyed today. Nobody knows how this bitcoin experiment will turn out; it is in progress.
Ive been touching plenty of grass, no dont you worry about that.
And me snow ⛄️
wise words sir, 👏 
enjoy 😉
Bro woke up and chose peace✌️
2023 hasn’t been a roller coaster at all. Well, I guess it’s been a roller coaster that just goes up. 

We’ve had like 3 fairly small red months outta 12 (so far). Pretty easy hodl year tbh
Breaking through this infamous multiverse... First steps in at this year's end.
Appreciate the Dips!which movie?
Meet Joe Black
🤣🤣🤣
That's me.. missed the dip 4 times in a row
RIP!
Such an underrated movie.
Hahaha, I wasn't expecting that ending.
Nice concept. Only traders that appreciate the dip thrive when it is hyperinflation season.
Brilliant.
that's basically me after listening to paid analysts who kept telling me for several months that a major correction is incoming
Points for originality on this one
Ag stupid 😂
Life is a terrible thing 🤣
Stupid ass Brad Pitt.
Brad Pitt interested in the world's most average chick?

This must be a movie.
10/10
It's not that I don't appreciate the dips, it's just that the dips happen to coincide with when I don't have extra money.
Someone definitely clipped that car accident and put it in limewire back in 2000 as "real car accident" and I thought it was real
Under the radar incredible movie
Spoiler Alert: Brad Pitt plays pinball with a couple of cars at the end of the movie
RIP the dip
