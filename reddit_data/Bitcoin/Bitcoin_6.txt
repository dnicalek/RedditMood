It’s palpable
Of what?
What’s everyone’s take on rumor (most agree it will) that an ETF will get approved by next week?  Versus the news once it does get approved or not?  Is the price now reflecting that it’s already going to be approved or will it go higher once the news hits that it is - by how much?  What if the news is that it’s again denied?  What’s the downside loss vs current pricing?
Downside is 40k, upside is 100k.
Where does MicroStrategy store its Bitcoin? Is it self custodied or does it use a third party to hold it?
I've seen comments on reddit that Coinbase is the custodian
My first comment here. Has anyone pointed out the peak of current rally of exactly 45000.00 occurred at exactly 5:00 on 12/5/2023? How is this not suspect?
How is this suspect?
44,700 was the highest on Binance on the 12th. It hasn't crossed 45000 yet as far as I know.
nope because nobody cares
 Mais alguém achando que sairá alguma notícia importante ainda esse ano que o levará aos 50k
Is Elizabeth Warren getting her bill passed yet? Is she running for president in 24?
*Stay stacking, my friends*

Looking for some front-running in the coming days, expecting some upward pressure through the weekend.
We won’t be hitting 100k based on ETF approval alone.
ETF, halving, and Fasb do though
Does it matter? Bitcoin is designed to appreciate on a big enough time horizon. Just don't throw money in that you need short term.
>Downside is 40k

awww just a puppy in bitcoin huh? 

bring it to 5k and let see who the real hodlers are
2023 Crypto RewindGood stuff
Brilliant!
All I have to give is an upvote dear sir
Love it
Man i had a good laugh!!
Told them to buy Bitcoin a year ago and got downvoted. They'd be up 250% on their investment now.its cause you say that not financial advice BS u shoulda said financial advice bishes
'not financial advice' is not just a cop-out clause, its a serious stay out of court clause.

There is nothing closer to a persons than their money.

Mess with this and you make a shit load of motivated enemies, and the legal system in most countries will gladly help them flay strips of flesh off of you one law suit at a time.

The ladder one needs to climb in order to become a certified financial adviser is long a torturous one. The unfortunate result is a walled garden that keeps the rarefied wealthy and their bags nicely insulated from the filthy rabble outside the gate.

Better would be to strip off not only the legal protections, but the wall itself. Let everyone sink or swim on their own merits.

*Ah, but what do we do about the poor snowflakes? boohoo.*
I’ve been all in for years. You’ll get this everywhere outside this sub unfortunately
I mean subreddits are basically echo chambers. Of course most people won't like bitcoin as an investment area, it's way too volatile for the common folk to put house money on the line for most people.
All technology, investing, and personal finance subs despise Bitcoin. It’s sad.
TBF, you put zero effort into that post.  You didn't make any case.

From their pov, you could have said buy shitcoin224.
Bingo.

Oh and buy baseball trading cards.
You said not financial advice
Ok. Still a risk though.

Also pretty garbage response in general.
Like the dude standing at the roulette table telling you he knew it was going to be red.
Yeah hindsight is 20/20 if it went went to 0 would you also take the credit OP?
And if he had said that 2 years ago the guy wouldn't have made a penny.
Suggested in my country sub like 2 months ago to a guy asking where is better to invest. He said he’d better use money for prostitutes. Saved the post to answer in 1 year.
Why not both? Tho on a prostitute not bad tbh
Just think if you'd opted to buy Bitcoin in 2012 instead of paying for that one prostitute you could afford to have every prostitute in the world come and visit you in 2024!
Wow great investment advice. Literally nothing to back up your advice.
Get this guy a trophy and strike up the band, what an economist/ soothsayer holy cow!
There’s a million of you all shouting stock tickers. Survivor bias.. y’all think you knew.. 

Anyways how many thousands did you put in?
>y’all think you knew..

Didn't we? Thinking you know and then being right is indistinguishable from knowing.

When you understand that bitcoin is the hardest money known to man, with an upgrade for the digital age and a breakthrough in global settlement, and know a bit about what has happened throughout history when easy money meets hard money (sea shells v gold), it seems like a fair conclusion.

Perception was an obstacle, as people are obstinate in general, but the persistent nature of the network was bound to wear down resistance over time.
Almost everything I have to spare for the last 7 years into BTC.

Might sell soon not sure yet (wife wants bigger home and I need 2 new cars
Receipts but the question is did you invest back then too
I hate these posts. You can be rebutted as just being lucky or only looking at a select timeframe. Bitcoin is different than any other investment because it’s not really an investment. It’s a new paradigm where your savings are the future unit of account you express wealth in.

Just saying you’re up X% in a year in dollar terms is contrary to the entire point of Bitcoin
Ok, this is really stupid. Just because it worked out at this specific time doesn't mean it was actually the right decision.

I believe in Bitcoin, but if you want to park your money for a time and need it after that why would you put it into something as volatile as Bitcoin?
Quit it with your logic
I still laugh at all the personal finance subs and investing subs. Once your fully orange pilled you know that everything is going to 0 against bitcoin and will severely underperform it with the added stress. 

It’s like living in the matrix
Don't tell anyone anymore. Let them watch you grow beyond their imagination.
"not financial advice"
Let them live their lives, my friend. Their choices.
Why did you give financial advice, then immediately say it's not financial advice?

If it wasn't financial advice, why are you seeking accolades from this subreddit for the advice you didn't give?
After seeing how they handled covid, I’d say 99% of whitecoats are total idiots.
What a good sign. When Miss Bity hits 1.000.000 they will finally upvote. But then the evil bear may come again and change their minds
Must feel good OP knowing you were right. I was in high school when BTC was around 800 when it had its first major bull run. Man I wish I had the money to buy.
Heard a funny quote today. Some of us choose to take the orange pill. The rest will end up taking the orange suppository
Let me say oh behalf of us, have fun staying poor! Hahaha fucking losers 🤣
HERES SOME FINANCIAL ADVICE****

****NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE


"THEY DIDNT LISTEN TO ME"
2 years ago I was told to invest in FTX, anyone know how that worked out?
How did you invest in FTX?
lol. what if you had told them to buy at 60k? In don't get these posts
@whitecoatinvestor[https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoinmemes/s/p0DrcpZIe5](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoinmemes/s/p0DrcpZIe5)
Mind your own business dude
Investment? Ahahahahahah
I bought BTC and I am more than 250% down.
Uh lol
[removed]
Explain how you achieved that.
Sold my house, got a new mortgage @ 3.125% gave half to investment advisors and put it in a trust for the kids, they pulled about 22%

I kept some averaged back in $16,000 and I’m up a few hundred percent 

Also fucked around and took 50k from Robinhood on $COIN and options by proxy
The world is full of sheeps bro, they all agree with eachother and think they are right because they have another thousand sheeps behind them saying the same thing without any facts or sense. Its like asking a toilet if shit tastes yum yum. Let them be, profit off these dumb fucks, dont fight it ;) if we were animals in the jungle they would be our feast. Were just living a modernized version of that.
I've been doing the same for years, I remember people telling me Bitcoin is a scam at £400 and arguing the case with them. Carried on doing this through £1000, £5000 etc and just started to say, "come back to this comment in two years time" - I'm actually tempted now to try and find my old coments and ask them if they are still happy to have ridiculed Bitcoin (and me!)
Because it’s a speculative asset…. You could turn this around and show multiple instances where people said ‘buy bitcoin’ and if the people followed that advice they’d be down.
My dad has spare capital just lying around and he’s always looking for ways to invest it. I’ve been on at him to buy BTC since it was around 8k. Even just a small amount. Just have a tiny bit in the portfolio. Why not?

Anyway. I’ve given up now. He would rather listen to the hot takes of crusty dinosaurs declaring all of crypto dead when some centralised exchange does some shady shit.
Why so smug? It's not like u could've predicted the turn out, for all you know it could've went all down for whatever reason. Literally gambling mindset.
Well you said it...that's a slogan, not financial advice 🤣 give people SOME respect for trying to be financially smart. "Buy Bitcoin" is a lazy strategy: how much? How often? If you're not going to try as hard as the OOP, just leave it alone.
You're a clown.
Why are you not a billionare, OP? Since you, in your financial clairvoyance, knew there would be massive profit to be made, I assume you took advantage of it yourself, invested all your funds, and came out with an easy 250% that you never doubted for a second.
But you didn’t justify it. I could’ve said buy Rolls Royce stock cos I thought it was cool. It went up but it could’ve just as easily went down. I can’t see how you could’ve proven empirically how bitcoin is undervalued and how the market will increase its valuation within a year. Please someone comment back to this how they value bitcoin’s intrinsic value and how they came to this conclusion. Otherwise it’s just pure gambling
This is a first year medical student. I am a fourth year currently and have been DCA for 3 years. Not many in medicine follow/believe in BTC
You can try to talk to someone once. Then Rule 2 of bitcoin applies. STFU.
With an investment horizon of 4 years bitcoin is a pretty bad "investment"
So what!  So you told them to buy btc and they didn’t follow your royal decree?  So sick of these posts - not even sure what your point is.  People will either make good decisions or they won’t, but either way they’re not obligated to follow the advice of someone they don’t even know on an internet site. 

Also, in case you didn’t know, doctors are known for their lack of appropriate financial decisions and many think they are simply the smartest person in the room, no matter the topic.
Well, you also gave the advice in the worst way possible. Don’t do sales /s.
😂
It is good in a way. It shows we are still ahead of the curve.
well not really as the casino has the odds slightly in their favour, even when just picking red or black (there are also green ones!) whereas Bitcoin has pretty amazing fundamentals. 
It would be like saying Warren Buffet just gambled when picking stocks.
More like the dude at the table saying it’s gonna be red, you then argue saying it’s not possible, only for it to indeed be red
Prostitutes are a depreciating asset.
They're an experience, not an asset
In one year I might actually answer this lol
Yeah i know what you mean, might sell mine soon, i need 3 lambos and a private jet
Or just sell the wife for more btc. ;)

Depends if you’re the pimp or the customer
Nice
Deepfake Saylor YouTube Ad — WTFThese fake ads are getting out of control and Google seems to not care and think they’re “ok” meanwhile they fuck over content creators with demonetization but let actual scams run on their network! Disgusting!
Creators of these fakes should be doxxed and banned from the platform. Google needs to be pressured to end this shit once and for all.
Class action lawsuits solve this.  Google needs to be sued to like a million times till they crack down on this.
Google is the scam
It's because no blue check marks come screaming at them and sponsors over scam ads, but someone doing wrong think and they go ape shit.
It's because they get money!
it's not just Google, they're all over my Twitter and TikTok feed too, for a while now
How do we know that it's not Google running these ads and scamming us out of our corn?
So ads still exist
yeah man get em! get em boy get em!!
How TF does an add like this get on YouTube? Is the marketing team over there that useless?
I wouldn’t be surprised. Or maybe they know but don’t care because the advertiser pays big $$$. FB has the same problem sometimes, fake ads to scam websites.
Humans don’t look at ads unless they get reported enough. Even then the people who review them are probably barely human.
They put it there based on your private information.

This shit is on my landing page (youtube.com) without a YouTube account.

It’s predatory and criminal. They know exactly what they are doing and it’s been going on for years.

They flag and filter ‘misinformation’, but somehow these crooks get a pass.

It’s clown world.
Youtube is led by useless mfers
WTFISGOINGON ADD IT
Bitcoin is an IQ test… with all due respect.
Still Youtube should be sued for allowing this to show on ads. The website is literally showing scams with zero consequences.
Couldn’t smash upvote hard enough
We live in a society today where people think there are safety nets all around you, when in fact reality is dangerous af and you need to stay sharp and play the game 3 steps ahead to win. 

I try to tell this to my wife, that the only way we will retire (win) is to accept the cold harsh realities and play the game as optimally as possible. I see no other options after how much the fking boomers screwed our generation. /rant

To your point, 100% an IQ test, and yet another great filter of social darwinism.
It’s a hard hat holidays, respectfully.
You sly motherfucker.
Fuckin A
 highly regarded minds everywhere agree the yellow crayons taste like lemons
If you're newbie it's easy to fall for scams. You think you're getting easy money and greed takes over. Then a "Saylor" convinces you to send you BTC and do stupid shit and your sats are gone. 

Rather than about intelligence I'd say it's more about awareness. It's important not do anything in a hurry but do the background checks (of a site, company, wallet address) and not be too gullible.
I posted here last week about a similar scam with Saylor deepfake to warn beginners but it got taken down by mods. You formulated your message better. :)

[https://who.is/whois/micro-strategy.io](https://who.is/whois/micro-strategy.io) says the State / Province is Sverdlovskaya oblast, RU.
Fucking RuZZians. They're truly a pest for the world - in everything... 💩🤮🤬
Still hasn't made it past the "uncanny valley."
Yea tell that to my aunt or grandma, who still haven't figured out that you can open your email on more than one computer.

Also tell that to the increasingly accepting younger generation, who might lean towards "oh hes just neurodivergent, thats why it sounds funny".

This is a big problem.
But I'm worried it'll be out of the valley in like 6 months. The rate of improvement in fake images in the past year has been insane; videos will just take a little longer.
I reported a few ones claiming that they are scams. Google came back to me saying that there is nothing wrong with them and that they aren't taking them down ...
Reporting videos they may tell you the outcome, but when I report ads it always tells me it will NOT tell me the outcome of the report. Which is frustrating because I'm not sure if I should bother.
It's wild how blatantly fake it is.  Such a common easy scam and fucking YouTube is complicit!!!!!   Saylor should be filing papers yesterday.
the Live streams on youtube with elon peddling some shitcoin were always funny.  I would always report them, but it never mattered.
the channels who got taken over turned into these creepy graveyards of once lively channels, it was eerie
Damn they are getting way better on this scams
People who fall for Youtube ad scams should consider suing Youtube.  They have a responsibility do more to prevent this crap from spreading.
Exactly. For better or worse and despite whatever level of ‘stupidity’, people associate these big companies with confidence and persistent quality.

You buy Budweiser anywhere on the planet and it taste like Budweiser.

You use Google or YouTube and you expect it to return legitimate results, as it typically does.

This isn’t some “Oh they searched for this shit so the algorithm suggested it”.

These scams are on the **homepage** as **featured content**.

It’s just plain old fraud.

Sure, plenty of us are morons, but if someone got a soft drink from McDonalds and it was filled with piss, would we just chalk it up to “they shoulda known better”?
Bitcoin is quite literally Survival of the Fittest playing out in real time.
Battle Royale of the internet
Bunch of scammers everywhere.
I know so many people that think Bitcoin is a horrible scam technology and AI is wonderful. They have it completely backwards
Saw another variation of this yesterday. I flagged it to YouTube and they pulled it down. Stay alert compadres. It's a villainous world out there
The giveaway scams are evolving
I report them every time i see them. They are actually very impressive. Its funny how criminals are always first to find ways to use new technology
If you fall for this you deserve to give up your Bitcoin
I feel bad for older folks who get suckered by these.  But I agree.
I bet they'll change their tone if Saylor sued youtube for this.
I see one of these at least once a week, but it’s Joe Rogan shilling some random workout gear / supplements
Done and... done..  

When do i get my doubled bitcoin?
Oh you missed the transaction fee. Please send more
Started to appear quite often indeed
TBH, how did the fuck up the lip-sync so bad? They went to the effort to train (or buy) a deepfake video and audio model yet didn't even bother to pay a reference actor for which the audio could be perfectly synced.
YouTube ReVanced will block ads on your phone. uBlock Origin will block them on your browser. Ads are vectors for scams and should be illegal.
Obviously it’s fake and you’d be an idiot to fall for it. The takeaway I have here is YouTube is allowing these things to be posted. YouTube is so quick to demonetize creators at the suspicion of a rule breaking. However, when it comes to them receiving money, they couldn’t care less what gets put out on the platform as an ad so long as they’re receiving money.
Too bad you didn't include the ad yt channel so we can mass report it.
only noob content creators upload videos to youtube. What you need to do is submit your youtube videos as ads so they show up on top of other videos. Bonus points if your "ads" playback over placeholder videos of a channel you control.
I noticed this ad last night and the ad was aired alongside a reputable crypto channel. (I know they don't have any say in which ads are displayed, but It's really a bad look for youtube.)
There's no such thing as a "reputable crypto channel" on YouTube. If you don't understand this, then you are at high risk of getting scammed.
Ugh fucking scam ass humans behind AI shit. I know, let’s use AI to scam people, yea such an original idea lol. Then, companies will be in on the scam so they continue to allow these ads to play on there websites. These dumbass humans will never know and the company gets a share of the crypto they collect for running these ads, win win! Sigh bad actor humans, everywhere!
Google fired most of their Sales team.

Yeah. Great job Google.

Don’t trust anything from YT now.
Seems legit…
Wow. The number of people that will fall for that....
I was watching some doc. on all these AI created videos, it’s pretty scary what they can do nowadays
Wow! What a great scam!.
For those that can't or don't know better. 
This will catch somebody.
Great post!
Yo my X (formerly Twitter) ads have been wild af lately as well. Has anyone else been getting weird ads on Twitter? Advertisers are desperate right now, quite unsettling to be frank.
Saw this. Impressive if nothing else.
Using 1960s technology:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3una-KbtfE&t=185s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3una-KbtfE&t=185s)
Naive people can still fall for that. How do we fight this deepfake with deepfake? Peter Schiff promoting the same?
Bull run signal
i was hoping other people saw through that bs. allot of people will fall for it tho sadly
All of the Michael Saylor videos appear to be AI generated.
No ship. Don't trust it
Been served this ad many times and it shocks me how bad it is and how it’s allowed on YouTube. I wonder what Saylor thinks of this!
I don't think this is a Google problem. This is a Human problem.  
Humans are always going to try to trick each other.  


Having a corporate censor isn't going to scale, and isn't going to work.  
We each have to take responsibility for our own well being and safety.  


AI will make things more complicated though.
Not buying this argument. Google is actively publishing this material, and taking payment for it. It's definitely a Google problem first and foremost.
Google won’t care until Saylor sues
Terrible that these don’t get removed instantly.
Damn. Well, did you find out if BlackRock can completely destroy Bitcoin?
A fool and their bitcoin are easily parted. If there is yield, you are the yield.
I saw an AI ad on YouTube of a CNN reporter. I don’t remember what they were selling or pushing but this is getting wild
Scanned the QR code, followed the website instructions but my bitcoin wasn’t doubled, in fact it was depleted 🤪✌🏽
Is there a subreddit blasting terrible YouTube ads? I'm sick of seeing them and want to know I'm not the only one!
I ran into this ad the other day. After a few seconds I was like “what he just say? Send my Bitcoin???”😂SKIP!
Damn... Nealy perfect. Wtf. Many will lose everything in this cycle
So scary good. Damn!
I will send one satoshi
Bro, that’s YouTube doing that ish…
I carried to click skip out of habit.
Did anyone else try the skip button?
I scanned the QR code and sent to double my money — Saylor is pretty stacked guy right? I’m beginning to wonder though because it’s been an hour and I haven’t received it back — Saylor said this promotion had the highest level of security so I am sure I have nothing to worry about right?
Saylor doesn’t wear a suit and tie
What amazes me is that ppl find their way to crypto but arent tech savvy enough to have ever heard about adblock.
Adblock doesn't help if the deepfake is on a video or "live stream". I often listen to Bitcoin talks on YouTube while driving. Happened to click a Saylor "live stream" (lol) which seemed to have a panel discussion: soon Saylor seems to advertise this giveaway where you can double your Bitcoin. :)
Ad block FTW!  Seriously, youtube, go fuck yourself sideways with a rake.  You are the devil.
If it makes crypto look bad and sketchy then it’s A OK 👌to those in power
The only thing that Blackrock will destroy wrt Bitcoin is the paper hand holders of bitcoin


BTC is far and above anything that a single entity could reasonably control beyond a short period of time
Google's AI told them it would be a "good idea" to allow these deep fake scam ads.

The AI said, "check Reddit, the comments will be gold."
This isn’t even the best quality fake of him that’s floating around right now.
This is truly technology gone too far. Unfortunately.
yeah 

"deep" 

shallow fake is more like it
😂
saw it before tried to report it but can't
well didn't google just get fined for spying on people's incognito sessions? they really can't be trusted
I'd love to see the translation of this from someone who can lipread.
Even  Google searches will link you to these scams. Without any search results saying this a scam.
I've seen a couple of Elon deepfake ads as well.

I'll probably be downvoted for this, but if you fall for these, then you win the Darwin Award.

Common sense tells me these multimillionaires don't really need your money lol
I'm not a major YouTuber.

I have 16k subs.

I have decided to make a video calling out YouTube with evidence.

It's insane a content creator makes a mistake and takes ad revenue from all creators to please their sponsors and at the same time does nothing to protect the consumer.

My take is YouTube is legally responsible for this.  These video ads play on crypto creators' channels.

If I were one of these creators I would be pissed that my community is being scammed.

YouTube has the technology to tell me my video can not be monetized or has copyrighted content within minutes, but they can't stop the same fake ads being played on their videos.  I call bullshit!!! They just don't care about it.

If you have any more evidence or stories of falling for these scams you can reply to this post and I maybe YouTube can monetize as it to my videos.

I'm not a crypto influencer at all on YouTube, I just don't think a big creator will call them out.
How the hell Google doesn't have an anti deep fake algo to block this.
1. Who the fuck doesn’t use ad block

2. How fucking stupid do you need to be to watch that and think it’s real
Youtube deserves to get sued for allowing this shit, I get these ads on almost every vid I watch now, starring everyone from deepfake Elon Musk to Michael Saylor and many, many others.

Can tell their fake now if you are actually paying attention because the way their mouths move but I usually notice from what they say as I know aint no billionaire making YouTube ads giving away crypto,

if you thought differently? Then you are likely to get screwed, especially the older less chronically online generations who really haven’t grown up with all this crap in development to train their brains to decipher AI deep fake bullshit.

Between Elon’s  absolute shit show take over of Twitter to the way Youtube and Facebook are ran there is few greater examples of a cancerous plague upon humanity
We must be entering the end game for the advertising-funded internet in its current from? Cyberpunk might have predicted it right.
You must be new here
Saylor Twift???
Saw this too. Was surprised that there was no way to report it. How is it even possible that this passes YouTube’s quality control.
And these same platforms are SO concerned about "misinformation" that free speech must be censored. Oh wait, they don't care at all about actual scams. 

They are only concerned about maintaining their iron grip on the political narrative.

If it doesn't impact their politics, they simply don't care.

Propaganda all the way down.
Oh im not missing this! Free Bitcoin!
Saw a similar with german speaking elon. Wild man
I saw this one the other day and couldn’t believe it was an ad on YouTube!!
Ironically if I make an ad with music I own the license to, YouTube will take down the ad without explanation nor care. Yet this goes on unaffected.
Looking forward to getting that $0.13 check 7 years later.
Been in crypto since 2013. thanks for the tip, Sport.
Sure you have been. You clearly have no clue that crypto and Bitcoin are not the same thing. You missed the point the other person was making.
Well, maybe the video feed hard to say. The voice work is new tech.
