Get your Bitcoin off exchanges and into a hardware wallet. 

Don't go chasing yield. Those offering you interest are swapping Bitcoin for absolute garbage to pay you shitty single digit yield. If it wasn't for them, Bitcoin would have reached $100K during the last bullrun. They surpressed it's price, before declaring bankruptcy.

I collaborated with The Rock Trading, I met them. That project had finished by the time they went under. It was weird watching them on TV making vague statements about problems with liquidity. They were an exchange, they weren't even offering yield, so there was no reason for them to become insolvent. although that has been true of many failed exchanges.

Thanks for posting this list, it will be handy to point to it next time somebody comes here wanting to entrust their coins to a custodian and asking "what could go wrong".
The difference is that it could never happen to me.
Almost 7% difficulty increase. Bullish.

Has anyone done research on the ETFs in Canada?
I have a few bitconi miners and am planning to expand my farm with the new generation \*21 miners. Does anyone have experience/information on using the High Energy Mode on the bitmain machines? T21 is supposed to have a mode for doing 20% higher hashrate than the basic settings

todays the day, i can feel it in ma plums!
The day we tread low 40s
I'm hoping for the dip today ‚ù§Ô∏è
A man can dream‚Ä¶
Dang sats are getting expensive. I am looking at my DCA purchases going back years and the number of sats my dollar bought then compared to now gives me the sads. On the other hand, knowing I never sold a single one of those sats gives me the glads.
That's pretty rads
Is it just me or has FUD been accelerating now over the past few days?
Merry XMAS from East to West!

HODLIHODLIHODLIHOOOO!

Add your btc xmas rhyme here:
This next bull run will make you flip your lids,

BTC is for the people, Wu Tang is for the kids.
Can BTC get some traction?

I would need to see some action!

Santa says You know it will bro

just you watch out for that ‚Ä¶
Any thoughts, insight, advice, guidance on purchasing Bitcoin through an single member LLC and holding as an asset?
The only reason for a single member LLC to exist is as a shield for personal liability. 
So they can steal from you, fold the LLC, and walk away.

I would literally rather buy from a guy in a dimly lit alley behind a corner store that sells loosies.
I hope btc doesn't lose its status as the one coin to rule them all but for some reason there is another coin pumping even though it was in bed with ftx and Sam and selling phones based off BONK airdrop...the space is contaminated with shit, but shit sells for some reason
Lol that always happens, shitcoins do mad pumps outperforming bitcoin for a few days, weeks, sometimes even months. But It never lasts. Like the hare and the tortoise.
Nigeria's central bank lifted its ban on banks from transacting in Bitcoin¬† -Reuters
*Virtual assets
No movement until Tuesday i guess
Usually pumps on Sunday night
does anyone know any research or approximates on how much hashrate is made with GPUs? i believe it‚Äôs impossible to calculate it only with blockchain data but maybe there are other methods
> how much hashrate is made with GPUs?

~0%, GPUs are not used to mine bitcoin (since 2013 or so).
Just need a whale with some balls üôè
I think OP might mean he would be the single member of the LLC intending to buy and hold Bitcoin.
I hope you are right man. Because seriously, if BONK and its related coin are at the forefront of the industry and become the face of the industry, then it is just what Gensler and Warren need to validate their bullshit hypothesis on the industry.
Stop advertising some shitcoins here you bought dude..  Shitcoins rise because people are stupid enough to buy them.
It won't pump on xmas eve
Watch your mouth!
yeah, it‚Äôs definitely a percent or two at most, but i need more exact value for my research
It's definitely much closer to 0% than to 1% :) It just doesn't make any economical sense whatsoever.  

And no, it's not possible to calculate or to see from the data, as you correctly recognized.
I finally fomo‚Äôd in.Keep stacking! Never stop, especially if you experience fomo etc. Best practice: DCA at e.g. Kraken. Also helps with better sleep ;D
Will do! üôèüèæ
He bought? domp it.
Damp inc
.04 club here.  Had .18 before but sadly had to cash a little in.
I always try to hold been cashing in and out like it‚Äôs currency lol. I‚Äôve read .01 too many times. So I‚Äôm in lol. Excited too.  I love talking about cryptocurrency ect
Life happens, all that matters is you continue moving forward one step at a time. 
Good luck in everything you do
Great! Now do 0.1!
Nice. OP... ignore the price action. You will see BTC drop between now and April, that is normal before a halving. Don't let it rattle you or ignite panic. Steel yourself for volatility, keep stacking slowly, take another peek at it this time next year.

When in doubt, zoom out.
Thank you. I hope it goes down lol. üòÇ I gotta get my son his own to watch now.
Better yet‚Ä¶..be excited to see BTC fall so you can increase your total holdings. I know, despite having sizable holdings‚Ä¶..I want/need more and since no plan on selling anytime soon‚Ä¶..would be ok if it drops 50% (it won‚Äôt)‚Ä¶..so I can double down long term holdings!
Congrats!
Keep buying- when you think you have enough- you don‚Äôt. Keep buying. Move in silence and congratulations
Welcome to millionaire status (in sats). That is first step.
lol here don‚Äôt worry this is much better timing than I, I fomo‚Äôd in 2021 lol bought in on all time highs nearly. Luckily that was not a terrible experience it did cost me worth a 100 or two but the lesson was priceless!! 

Keep watching for lower buy in opportunity!
Is Black rock buying btc from the us govt?Okay so hear me out. The govt is selling its confiscated btc to the institutions in preparation for the ETF‚Ä¶.No. The government has to report all of these sales. We would know ahead of time.

They haven't sold in a while.
The same government that cannot keep track of billions of dollars‚Ä¶.
Just curious ‚Äî who *exactly* arranges and signs-off on those sales? How does that work?
Just because they *have to* doesn't mean they will
Yeah the government would never hide anything from us... Right?
Blackrock owns politicians.  They are the government.
The government doesn't "have" to do anything, who is gonna make them or stop them?
"The government has to..." Hahahahaha ok that was a good one
Ha ha, your funny.  The politicians are corrupt
We would also see all these sales regardless
Yeah they report everything honestly...
Do you honestly think that the government tells everybody everything that they buy and sell? We are talking about the u. S government. Anytime a politician opens Is their mouths they Lie
Hodl
The same government who sold over 20,000 BTC in a "bear market" seized from silk roads and other entities... ok, Sure
Nope, mainly Coinbase.
Wait until you find out how ETFs are really used by institutions
Do I have to go down the entire rabbit hole for myself or are you going to sum it up for me?
Yep. Those Bitcoin Spot ETF's will be paper ledger transactions not real bitcoin ownership by the investors, aka clients of the insitiutions offering the ETFs. Maybe Bl;ackrock et.al. have a plan to reduce volatility in bitcoin price; I cannot imagine the pension funds, for example, accepting wild price swings between bear and bull markets.  pension funds have fixed obligations each month and sending out IOUs to policy holders (actual retirees) will not fly.
No they are buying from weak hands
The question is, is black rock buying bitcoin FOR the US government!
Real questions. Possible honey pot for future executive order confiscation a la 6102.
No they're buying it from Coinbase.  The fuck man you all live under a rock this is going on 6 months old news now.
Possible. But the ETF will really start to buy once they're approved. They will buy/sell Bitcoin according to customer demand. 
These etf make money from management fees, nothing else.
Damn.

This is actually a good psyop lol.
1 BTC = 1 BTC.  

We are going to be in for a bunch of chaos over the next decade.  But if you can HODL with strong hands:

1 BTC = 1 BTC


Don‚Äôt sell your stash to the Robber Barons when they try to entice you.
They will never entice us...they will come with threats and fear.
Yes. But also dumping it outright on the exchanges to suppress prices.
The biggest btc mining company in the world is Marathon Digital Holdings in which Blackrock has a 7% ownership.

Mara just bought two new btc mining sites: [https://cointelegraph.com/news/marathon-buys-two-bitcoin-mining-operations-170m](https://cointelegraph.com/news/marathon-buys-two-bitcoin-mining-operations-170m)

I believe that Blackrock will be buying bitcoin directly from Marathon digital holdings.
Blackrock doesn‚Äôt really own 7% of MARA, their ownership is on behalf of its customers.
Its a possibility
Blackrock buys the BTC straight from its own miners, they own a shit ton of BTC miners.
It‚Äôs in a public ledger, we would find out eventually
the gov has a bunch of different branches with different agendas but for the most part they are hoarding it all the same as black rock
Blackrock and vanguard will soon being buying up most of the bitcoin from anyone who‚Äôs selling. They won‚Äôt need the government. They‚Äôll be in control just fine on their own.
I believe they get direct from miners
Nah think it would have been leaked. I don‚Äôt think those deals can happen under the table legally.
The government just lent it to them.
The us gov lost their keys
Boat accident
If anyone is front running, it would be congress. Those MFers love to trade on inside information.
yep, and the etf forces all holders selling bitcoin to deliver to blackrock as well!
...the same gov't that illegally seized an Iranian oil tanker and sold the oil? haha
Trillions***
That's because there's no blochchain for DoD transactions.
No, like when the CEO of a company has to report sales of stock to the SEC... the government has to do the same with assets it sells.

It can lose all of the dollars it wants, wherever it wants to, it doesn't do that with hard assets. Those are audited. Every time the government sells BTC, it reports the upcoming sale ahead of time. None of these sales are secret or a surprise.
The Pentagon has failed audits 6 years in a row.
There's a government?
Google is ready to answer your questions.
Are you joking? How delusionaly large do you imagine Blackrock to be?
They're the majority share holder of the majority of companies
|How delusionaly large do you imagine Blackrock to be?

Oh boy...do we tell them?
Thought you said ‚Äúdeliciously large‚Äù there for a minute.
Larger than the US / China Opium trade of the 19th century that saw international merchants and smugglers rise to generational political dynasties in the US.  

Blackrock sits on over $10 trillion AUM, or about 1/3 of the US annual GDP or over 1/2 of China's. 

For reference, all mortgage debt in the US outstanding is about $19 trillion.

The total market cap of gold is 13.8 trillion

APPL MCap is 3.01 trillion

Last recorded market cap of the entire NYSE was at 28.5 trillion [recorded](https://www.nyse.com/market-cap) on 6/30/18

Total net wealth of the US has been previously recorded at 123 trillion. 

They control more assets than most countries. They have a little weight to throw around.
Black rock is probably more than government than the actual government
The other 2 branches of the government? Whoever the party out of power is?

LMAO, kiddo, when you make it to 5th grade checks and balances are going to blow your mind.
Not sure if serious or just regarded
I mean, we know where those coins are and the movement is easily tracked. They couldn‚Äôt move them without people knowing.

Here‚Äôs you an appetizer
A 70 page appetizer. Great heavens!
That‚Äôs more than an appetizer, I feel like I‚Äôll forgo the dessert menu.  I was expecting a fluff piece from mother Jones.  Not a peer reviewed article from a reputable source.  3 pages in and I wanna adjust my whole Roth IRA portfolio.

Thanks stranger, this makes me less nostalgic for the Bitcoin ETF‚Äôs.
This paper is not applicable to the upcoming(?) spot BTC etfs because they are cash creates, not in-kind. 

On top of that, the "operational" shorting mentioned in the paper is not a directional bet, it is effectively a spread trade. In the paper, the AP sells the shares to the ETF (create) and then hedges while looking for a better fill before delivering the shares to the ETF. In cash creates (spot BTC etf), the AP must deliver the cash up front.

This is not an institutional short selling conspiracy. Without looking at your profile, I'm going to guess you invest in GME.
Trading a commodity, which bitcoin is, using short selling, can be more complex due to the specific characteristics of the commodity market and the influence of factors such as inventory and physical supply of goods.
Right, but there's an obligation for the funds to hold Bitcoin. The shares represent these holdings.

Pension funds don't have to hold this etf..
Oh, there's a ledger.

Just no concensus..
That's a different body entirely, and a notoriously opaque and secretive one.  Your argument is a non sequitur.  Not to mention, they undergo hundreds of separate audits all the time, every year.
The "different body" that is under the direct control of president, is viewed as a direct part of the government by the majority of Americans, is voted on by Congress to receive ~$850 billion dollars in tax payer money every year, who can't account for $2.3 trillion in transactions, and who fails audits with zero repercussions? And that's somehow a non-sequitur for myself and others being skeptical of government accounting?

You can kiss my ass bud.
If blackrock did not want a Bitcoin ETF, we would not be getting one.

They control Wall Street.  Unfortunately Wall Street elects our politicians.
Haha right, some people still think these huge hedge funds aren‚Äôt pulling strings with the government every single day. BlackRock can do whatever they want.
>majority share holder of the majority of companies

That's hyperbolic to the extreme, and even with their major holdings in large companies, that does not make them "the government".
Some people are not ready to be freed from the matrix. They are so dependent on the system they will fight to defend it. Just do some light reading into Black Rock, State Street and Vanguard. If you want to go further down the rabbit hole üêá you can look into the DTCC, Failures to Deliver, Fiat currency vs Commodity Backed Currencies, Naked Short Selling, ESG scores, Central Bank Digital Currencies, The Federal Reserve, Fractional Reserve Banking
You don't need to tell me anything. I know everything you're going to tell me. I think the critiques of Blackrock are overblown, and mostly rooted in not understanding how this works. When people say comical thinks like "they hold a majority stake in most companies" I know not to listen. Such a person doesn't know what they're talking about.
Haha...ok.

It is the free bread before the meal is served 30 minutes later.
It‚Äôs still profitable to trade and has long term potential. But, how long one can suffer through any dumps is subjective though. YW. Just keeping it real from my experience with securities trading.
What's the tldr? I'm illiterate
BlackRock can suffer through the dumps, but they‚Äôll end up centralizing enough BTC to smooth out (and control) those dumps.
Appreciate the document.  I will read all of it, with a more charged device.
There are multiple ways to long and short ETFs. You trying to disparage some minuscule difference in spot ETFs to satisfy your argument that nothing could be used by this vessel to manipulate Bitcoin exchange prices isn‚Äôt realistic.
Yes you can use ETFs to short. This paper does not discuss that. And even if it did, the spot BTC etfs use cash creates, so the paper does not apply. See above.

You don't understand the paper that you linked.
And yeah, it‚Äôs quite applicable. Especially, with liquidity. No one has to look at your profile to know that you attempt to dissuade any information that creates concern over buying and holding long or simply trading it for quick profits or to minimize losses.
Not if you‚Äôve secured positions in exchanges, lending, mining, futures contracts, collateralized loans to those trusts holding, options and actually possess enough of the total which doesn‚Äôt require even majority holdings in that asset.
lmao, kiddo, I get it your mad people are disagreeing with you.

But no need to tearfully yell your best insults, champ. You‚Äôre wrong. It‚Äôs ok. OP is right that the pentagon is different and doesn‚Äôt liquidate hard assets.

Take a nap, sport. You‚Äôre getting cranky LOL
Listen, pal...sport...buddy...
This dude has anger issues...üëÜ
I have no idea why you're getting so worked up about this.  Different people, different organizations, is it a surprise they act & operate differently?  It's just an observation.  No need to get butt hurt.
BIDEN TURNS THE GAS PRICE KNOB AND YOU CANT TELL ME DIFF'RENT
lol, you are such a cliche
I know it seems strange but I think Elizabeth Warren was elected because of Blackrock.  They are able to suppress price of BTC cause of her.

If the ETF is approved. Blackrock does not want us to be able to withdraw BTC and cause even more of a shortage of coins on exchanges.  I believe they also forced Senator Cynthia Lummis to go Rogue (maybe they found dirt on her).

Maybe Blackrock will try to get all the miners in their hand and fork BTC later.

They Came, They Saw, They Conquered.
Yeah, it's why most ETFs I hold are Blackrock products. Some of us aren't paranoid luddites.
This is a casino

The document "ETF Short Interest and Failures-to-Deliver: Naked Short-Selling or Operational Shorting?" explores the disproportionate share of short interest and failures-to-deliver (FTDs) in ETFs relative to their market capitalization. It introduces the concept of "operational shorting" linked to the ETF creation/redemption process, distinguishing it from naked short-selling. The study finds that operational shorting correlates with improved liquidity but raises systemic risk concerns due to the interconnectedness and leverage of ETF market makers. The paper also examines the impact of operational shorting on the liquidity and pricing of ETFs and their underlying securities.
Market makers sell shit they don‚Äôt own and make shit tons.
Blackrock: Permit me to issue and control the money of a nation and I care not who writes the laws.

You get done with that then here‚Äôs another good read.

https://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/lkcsb_research/5315/
That paper is one of many. It‚Äôs about operational shorting. There‚Äôs also synthetic ETF shorting. Get over yourself. lol, you ain‚Äôt fooling no body with your weak attempts to mitigate Bitcoin damages. It and other crypto exchange prices are highly manipulated. This spot ETF is just another tool used by institutions at the expense of retail.
I dunno man, you haven't been too convincing either. Can you explain in your owns words what the article is talking about and how it applies to the Bitcoin ETF?
Hold on just a second there pal I'm not your buddy, sport!
LMFAO
üòÇ Dude there‚Äôs more information to support that Wall Street has manipulated markets with various financial instruments than there is to support some of y‚Äôall‚Äôs argument of ‚ÄúWell Bitcoin is different.‚Äù I do not care if you use the information or not. Anyone that denies that it can‚Äôt or hasn‚Äôt already happened in crypto is kind of a clown in my book.
1M of satoshis costs only 438 bucks and438 bucks next year can buy so much less stuff because this keep being debased...


keep rumble, Stack sats, we are so early, Stack fastNice calculator bro!
https://www.kraken.com/learn/satoshi-to-usd-converter
Cant wait til unit bias shift toward sats instead of bitcoin.

If exchanges repriced things as $1 usd = x amount of sats, I feel people would have an easier time accepting or buying bitcoin.
Next year:

one d√≥lar = one satoshi
2.1 quadrillion dollars market cap. Sure ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Next year??  That would be incredible. I‚Äôll settle for that happening in 10 years.
Dude if we even come close to $0.01 USD = 0.00000001 BTC, I will suck my own toes.
No
Dumb
We have to stop thinking or BTC or satoshi in terms of fiat currency. However, we cannot do it until we stop tying the economical value of BTC to the fiat system. We will not see such a decoupling until fiat currencies on a global scale are replaced by a bitcoin-based currency.

If 1 SAT === USD1.00, then 1 BTC === USD100,000,000.00. So unless 1 BTC is capped at USD1M, the cost of goods and services will continue rising (inflation) as the smallest unit, the satoshi, likewise increases from USD1 to USD1 to USD3...to USD(infinity). While an upper limit for 1 BTC will ultimately be discovered, and it must be found for practical purposes, the smallest unit 1 SAT will potentially price many people out of even owning 1 SAT.

The original vision of bitcoin has been lost forever, in my opinion. It was intended as a peer-to-peer trustless payment system which offered people financial freedom in the sense their bank or the government could not freeze access to their own money. Bitcoin seemingly is a way to retire or flaunt one's wealth in its present use as a high-risk  investment.
Too early for this rate
Trash token
satoshi isn‚Äôt a ‚Äútoken‚Äù.
