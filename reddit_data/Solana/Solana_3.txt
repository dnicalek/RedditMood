Your opinion on upcoming BTC ETF approval and it's effect on SOLhttps://preview.redd.it/hsr5fhiapv7c1.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad8d9855e6392608a1c1e71820c4358b3da11e3c

With Bitcoin ETF approval imminent we're likely going to see a heavy price spike for altcoins. What are your thoughts about this? I'd like to get the community opinion about what they expect to see and general sentiment about this approaching event. What effects do you think this will have on SOL?

Thanks in advance! A link to the article with related details below incase you're curious.

Total market cap of crypto may rise to 2 trillion in January would be epic. I think 20-30 billion would flow into Solana next month
More like 125B into Solana alone.
It continues to add more legitimacy to the whole space. Maybe it's not an immediate major effect. Short pump or short drop on profit taking. Another year or 2. It'll be great for overall market
Because of all the leverage BTC rising would have a big impact on Sol. But I think the real ETF impact will be quite small at first. Might actually result in a sell off if people don't see the volume they thought it would create.
True but we are headed into an election year, with rate cuts expected or atleast expected to stay the same without increase. There are a lot of macro changes in the positive. I do see what you're saying about a possible sell off, but this has been a long time coming and I'm expecting BTC to hit ATH again. Maybe you're right though, it may be a slow burn to get to the moon if the volume increase does not pan out.
Depending on how it moves btc, sol should follow soon after

Personally, I believe the etf is already priced in
I think that the Monkey will get it's haircut
❤️
🚀 🚀 🚀
All boats…
Looking at the way Solana has maintained its steady growth over the past few days, I can't say this is just a pump and dump. It's also retesting, so investors are cashing out huge profits. A $300 value by the end of the week seems imminent.
$LOLI - ETF is right around the corner (or so i’ve heard) 😈
Pedo coin.
Solana will ETF
Yea, i would be. we will get a sol etf by 2025.
I’m gonna take a nap, let me know when Sol hits 300
Set an alarm, will be too busy shopping for lambo lol
Number go up
it will not have an effect on solana
What make you say that?
ape brain
i beg your pardon? 🥺
Do you know what Loli means?
anime girls but small?
It's young anime girls that are sexualized and look like children. So yes it's very pedo-like
It’s stands for Lolita you can watch the movie or read the book if you don’t know
Did you hear about gptsol ?
It typically means a young anime/manga girl, often used on characters with child-like appearances. It also has sexual connotations, which is why you NEVER refer to a real child as a "loli". 

Also I'm pretty sure "Lolita" was popularised by a book about an older man obsessed with a younger girl.
🥺🥺😂
no, tell us about it
GPT SOL? It’s like stumbling upon a treasure chest in the crypto jungle, but instead of a map, you’ve got AI as your savvy guide, and the community’s got the compass. We’re on the Solana rocket, where every ‘Aye Aye, Captain!’ from you steers the ship. Hold GPTSOL, and you’re not just a deckhand; you’re in the captain’s council! Want to join the crypto treasure hunt? Now’s the time—before we’re not just waving from the moon, but hosting intergalactic luaus!
so...you've got a llm ai doing what exactly? speak plainly. got a white paper?
Solana vs. Ethereum: Who Wins?”Imagine this: You’re playing an epic video game, and you’ve got two choices for your gear. One is kinda slow, can glitch when too many players jump in, and yeah, it’s got a cool rep and all. That's Ethereum for ya. Then, there’s this shiny new gear - it's like lightning, super smooth no matter how many are in the game, and doesn’t cost you a ton of gold. Enter Solana, the high-speed, low-drag option.

So here’s the deal: Solana is like that new skateboard that’s all about speed and smooth rides. It uses this rad tech called Proof of History, so instead of waiting around to take your turn, you just zip through, doing your blockchain thing. Ethereum’s still trying to catch up, planning to switch from their old-school board to a faster one, but Solana’s already doing kickflips and ollies around the block.

And it's not just about being fast. Solana's got these tricks up its sleeve - stuff like Gulf Stream and Turbine - that make it a powerhouse. Imagine streaming movies with zero lag while your bro's still buffering - that's Solana in the blockchain movie theater.

So, the big question - can Solana totally outpace Ethereum and become the next big boss in the crypto world? It’s got the moves, it’s got the tech, and it’s not slowing down. But hey, in the world of crypto, it's all about the next level. And right now, Solana’s hitting that turbo button hard.WARNING:

Your analogy is good. Except that Ethereum is already miles ahead… Do you go with the token that’s already miles ahead or with the new shiny fast one? That’s the really question.

My answer: Both. 

I have equal amounts in both because I believe both will do very well but in all honesty I am swaying more towards SOL in the long run…
Choosing between established giants and the next big thing is the classic crypto dilemma. But why not both? Only issue with eth is the gas fees.. 

Did you hear about GPTSOL , it is the shining star on Solana, aiming for a SHIB-like ascent! Grab your GPTSOL now while the market cap is just warming up. 

Check GPTSOL/SOL on DEX Screener and join the ride to the moon. 🚀💫
What's your take on Cardano (ADA) when compared to ETH & SOL? I've been hearing it's been making use strides recently and it's price has also been on a bit of a rip lately.
I don’t know why everyone is like fuck ETH, SOL is gonna crush it! Like…. Both can and will do well…. Toly said so himself lol… this narrative that SOL is the ETH killer is so cringe 😬
this is the cringiest shit i've ever read
Cringe is good 🫣
Cringe only replies ☝️
and you ask this in a sub that's completely Solana biased...

Suggest you open this up to a broader crypto sub for a more balanced perspective
https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/s/y98eYeb9DL

Just posted on eth group let’s see the replies and we judge then ☝️
I own both but ETHEREUM!!!
Toooo pricy
at the moment ethereum still big daddy of alt coins and likely this bullrun but solana will likely catch a lot of ethereum’s clients🤷‍♂️
Daddy is old and slow ..
I love Solana ❤️
 Who doesn’t
They aren’t in competition with one another.
I think otherwise ..
Who wins this cycle it depends on what you consider a win… If it’s strictly market cap and adoption probably ETH.. If it’s percent gains it’s hands down Solana.. Now next cycle it’ll be harder to answer..
Agreed 🚀🚀
Sol.
For sure
so how come you didn't feel this way when it was worth 8$?
Isn’t that the thrill of crypto? Back then, it was the sleeper hit nobody talked about. Now, it’s the main character everyone can’t stop buzzing about. Stay tuned, the plot is just thickening!
It depends on which subreddit you're on
Nope , I kindly disagree
sol is still young

blockchain is a growing space, there will be loads of competition to come just like how btc has lost its dominance over the years. when the hype fades and smoke clears, not all competition can stand the test of time. btc and eth have. sol has done GREAT so far.

large caps have "limited" ROI, mid caps and small caps have much larger ROI potential but lets not jump the gun and ignore how the money [flows](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fcrypto-money-flow-cycle-v0-vas4ul3tlbtb1.png%3Fwidth%3D1080%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3Df62172ed5a2836291385bd4e658a63e708470b30) in crypto or markets overall, obviously over time this will evolve

u really think all the btc n eth whales that bought up SOL at the lows with their btc n eth are just gunna leave massive profits sitting in markets without taking massive profits.

btc dumps 10%, eth dumps 20% sol dumps 40%, rinse and repeat
Exactly, Sol’s youth is its edge – agility and innovation in its DNA. And as for ROI, the crypto ecosystem thrives on diversity and the potential of the underdogs. It’s not just about following the money, but also about where the next wave of innovation leads.
Long term I believe in SOL, but again this is the sol sub and ofc that would be the majority of the responses given 

Eth is too high in cost for everyday users/usage and also the congestion  is a serious issue
Absolutely, the affordability and scalability of SOL make it a promising player in the long game. Ethereum’s pioneering status is commendable, but the future of crypto is all about inclusivity and accessibility. Here’s to hoping both can adapt and thrive!
Both.
 Nobody has to win, I only want Sol to reach $500!
Hahaha same !
ETH for the already rich, SOL for everyone else.
Sol is the peoples money
The one who doesn’t drop to its knees for regulations and control wins. Crypto is and should always be a free market as intended by Satoshi Nakamoto. With no interference of big corporations or banks.

Tip: Go see the movie “The Big Short”
Couldn’t agree more! In Satoshi we trust, and in the free market, we HODL. Banks? We don’t need no stinking banks! We’ve got blockchain, baby! And yeah, ‘The Big Short’ is my kind of financial horror movie – who needs zombies when you’ve got the 2008 housing market? 😅 #DecentralizeEverything

Ethereum fees are a waste of money and returns. L2s are a maze and a mess.

Who needs a crystal ball when you’ve got SOL, right? Flipping ETH might not be on today’s agenda, but the crypto world is full of surprises. And while we’re on the topic of pleasant surprises, have you checked out GPT SOL? It’s the kind of play that could give your SOL bag a buddy—or maybe even outshine it. Why settle for double when you can aim for the stars? 🚀💫 #GPTSOL
Solana for life !
Hell yeah baby ! Let’s goo
$POPO wins
Not really delved into Cardano to be honest. I don’t really want to spread my resources round too much but obviously it’s got some clout. Doesn’t seem to be attracting much attention lately though…
Cardano was the SOL of 2020. It’s kinda the worst of both worlds.

More in line with the decentralized/censorship resistance ethos of crypto than SOL, but not more than ETH.

Slower than SOL and ETH L2s (even ETH mainnet not too long ago, but maybe this changed?)
What do u mean?
Gas fees my friend
We need a bull who can run and fly haha
no doubt but big money have invested too much on eth, and they don’t care about fees or slow, just has to be steady. regardless i had been investing in solana since when it was around $6 even whrn it reached its ath at $260🤡. bought some more at $9 or so. i can payoff my house if i sell right now but I like the risk😂🤔🤡
And expensive!
Yo, listen up, here’s the tale of the chain,
ETH’s the old guard, SOL’s the new brain.
ETH grinds like a truck, fees hit like a train,
While SOL’s zipping by, in the hyper-fast lane.

Ethereum, yeah, it laid down the street,
But Solana’s got the rhythm, got that gas-less beat.
Paying so much for gas, that just ain’t discreet,
When SOL does it for less, ain’t that neat?
You should be more concerned with AVAX.
Why ?
You never know things will change when maybe in near future eth gas is lower and faster
Maybe yea 😚
L2s my friend. By march, L2s will be as cheap/cheaper than solana. All while mainnet remains being economically sustainable/deflationary.
🫣🫣
It seems to me, fees on Solana will have to go up in the future to make it a little profitable or for the validators.
Do you know about gptsol.co ?

it’s a scam and a trash 🚮
Because there’s higher % chance (in my mind) that AVAX overtakes Solana than Solana overtaking Eth.

Even with the ridiculous week Sol has had, it’s not even any closer to Eth in terms of total market cap. Both gained around 10 billion over the past 7 days. It’s not catching Ethereum. Ever.
Market cap is just one way to measure a network’s value. Let’s not forget the tortoise and the hare; slow and steady wins the race, and innovation plus utility can lead to unexpected outcomes. Let’s see where the tech takes us! 
#ILOVESOL
sol ain overtaking eth anytime soon

eth would flip btc way b4 that were to happen.

majority profits flow into/out of stable coins btc n eth before mid caps n small caps.

without btc pump and without eth dominance holding strong, alts do nothing. its only AFTER btc n eth start moving the rest join the party and show better returns. and then it dumps so we can do it all over again
Hey there! It’s always good to approach every project with a healthy dose of skepticism - it keeps us all sharp. 🧐 GPT SOL is all about transparency and community. We’re building something special, and we encourage everyone to do their own research. Check out our site, join the conversation, and see for yourself what we’re about. We’re here to run, fly, and maybe even soar together. Let’s turn skepticism into opportunity!
Hey fair enough, I’ve loved Eth for a long time, but if Sol replaces it, then so be it. It will only replace Eth if it ends up being warranted.

I was just trying to showcase the massive hill that Solana has to climb in order to reach Eth’s market cap.
Agreed 100%
