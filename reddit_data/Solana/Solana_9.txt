Jupiter Set to Initiate Major On-Chain Movement with $JUP Launch in Last Week of JanuaryThe Jupiter exchange is revolutionizing the DeFi space with the launch of its governance token, $JUP. Jupiter announced the $JUP airdrop for its platform users in November during Breakpoint, emphasizing growing the pie. The total number of wallets eligible to claim the airdrop is 942,000. This launch is not just a routine event; it's a bold step towards establishing on-chain launches and DEX trading as the norm for top-tier projects in the cryptocurrency world.

Jupiter's strategy is firmly centered on promoting on-chain launches and DEX trading. By focusing 99.999% of their effort on on-chain activities, they aim to set a new standard for token launches, moving away from traditional reliance on centralized exchanges (CEX).Â Jupiter is working closely with top infrastructure partners, Triton One and Helius Labs, to scale up RPCs on both the front and back end. This collaboration ensures a robust infrastructure capable of handling the demands of an on-chain launch.

In collaboration with Solana labs, Jupiter is closely monitoring the rollout of Solana's 1.17 update, which is expected to enhance performance and resolve existing issues. The plan is to proceed with the $JUP launch only after confirming this update's stability and full deployment, ensuring a smooth on-chain experience.

A total of 10 billion $JUP tokens will be minted, split equally into two cold wallets. From the team wallet, 10% will be allocated for liquidity provision; from the community wallet, 15% will be used for the first airdrop and community needs. The team's LP account will initially use 5% for the token launch pool. Overall, 15% to 17.5% of the tokens will be liquid from day one, with the rest securely stored. All allocations will be stored in clearly marked wallets, easily trackable by the community, and monitored by bots. The team is considering acquiring .SOL domain names for these wallets to enhance transparency and ease of tracking.

Jupiter's launch is not just about the technical aspects; it's deeply rooted in community engagement and education. They are committed to creating an inclusive environment where the community is involved at every step and well-informed about the on-chain ecosystem. Aware of the scrutiny and potential skepticism, especially from those critical of Solana, Jupiter maintains its focus on its objectives, emphasizing collective learning and industry-wide improvement.

In conclusion, Jupiter's $JUP token launch sets a new precedent in the DeFi space. It's not just a token launch; it's a campaign to make on-chain launches and DEX trading the gold standard for top projects. By blending technical excellence with a strong community focus and innovative tokenomics, Jupiter is poised to lead a significant shift toward a more decentralized and transparent future in cryptocurrency trading and governance.

Man, reading this I have to revise my older statements that Jupiter can't get anymore awesome than it already is. Very excited to see how this shakes out, and I'm truly impressed with the level of collaboration between the Jupiter team and Solana.
Yes ser very excited for what they have in store for us.absolutely gigchad team
And remember.... if you receive 10k worth of tokens you have 15 days to report it to the IRS if you're in the US due to digital assets being added to reporting laws as of Jan 1st.... don't ask me how tf you do it... I just know they threaten a felony if you don't.
Mistakes were made from the wallet i control
Not only do you need to report it, but you need to report the SSN of the sender!
We made a Solana 2023 Recap page so you can view your 2023 journeyHi there I'm Thanh Le founder of Nimbus

Inspired by Spotify Wrapped we made a page for Solana on which you can get your 2023 recap on on-chain activity, NFT, airdrop

You can also mint an NFT which we have 4 types based on your historical activities

Show us how proud we are when we're Solana users. It would cost me 432$ in TX fee If I used Ethereum ðŸ«   


I will post the link in comment

99% accurate ser
such a nice idea, love it. thank you
I'm happy that you like it
super cool. Just made a recap nft for myself
cool\~
Dont connect your wallets! This is not an official one from Solana.
if you don't mint NFT, we do not require you to send any tx
Please be vigilant. Hope no one gets duped by this.
We updated the code so you just input your wallet, no more connect to get your 2023 Recap.  


Cheer
Free tier being <$2k feels very limiting. I can't really get an idea of the features sadly.

Nice UI and nice general overview however.
I just had to connect and sign, so I'm not sure that's live yet.

Phantom Wallet
Using what dapp?
Solflare has price data for many more coins than phantom, plus supports local currency support.
I use phantom wallet never had a issue so far
they don't have all the tokens / trending pairs on dextools
No wallet has trading tools that I'm aware of
Get telegram and install BonkBot. Use burner.
Do u get push notifs?
