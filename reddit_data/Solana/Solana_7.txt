Releasing first half of this year, it was put on the test network. When the tweet dropped along with many other articles on it in October the pump started.
It's not Firedancer though.  What's on testnet is "Frankendancer", which is a thin layer of new networking stuff + the normal Solana Labs code for everything else.

True Firedancer is not something that has been tested anywhere nor is complete and I'm not sure how much longer it will be before it is.
Itâ€™s not priced in yet I feel. 

Once itâ€™s released then it be too late cause price explosion would have happened.
Agreed.
if itâ€™s already on test network and working successfully then itâ€™s priced in.
Who cares!!!
They're hard at work https://github.com/firedancer-io/firedancer/commits/main/
Well the endless barrage from eth maxis on how solana still in beta and prone to breakdowns disputes that claims.

Solana already overtaking eth in multiple metrics. 

Once Firedancer is out then decisively the break down claim will be put to rest and I feel thatâ€™s when it will be priced in.
Sheeeesh. Just keep the ace in the hands until the rocket is ready
is the testnet accessible to the public? any RPC released?
No it's not.  What's been tested is "Frankendancer" which is just a portion of new code (the networking layer), and none of the actual transaction processing or voting or validation or anything done in the new "Firedancer" way.
You donâ€™t hear updates because real hustlers r working. You bet your ass itâ€™s big.
