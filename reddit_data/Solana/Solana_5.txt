Casual observations from a crypto lurker
Satoshi dared to dream of a world free from corruption with some simple code. 
The world laughed and he disappeared. But had enough disciples to create the religion. 

VB transmuted ether from the religion and gave the world a path to reach satoshis dream using more complex code. 
The world took notice and made it possible to trade one religion for another in metaverse. 

Anatoly just added scale to the equation so people can build business models that‚Äôll make the technology accessible for everyday life. 


That is innovation. Taking an awesome idea and adding onto it inside of an open market where people can decide how to use it. 

Btc will always have their heroes journey on behalf of the free world. 

Eth will always have their worlds to create

Solana will onboard the masses to the technology. 

There is no overlap.
And there is no guarantee that any of the parties will achieve their missions alone. 

I think we are the only ones are able to understand each other. While the rest of the world still sees crypto as a ponzi. A scam. A cult. WARNING:

I Hope solana can onboard a billion users into crypto. 

I love Solana and BItcoin.
This guy has done proper research.
Onboarding is great, but there needs to be a more concerted effort from dexes and the community at large to protect the brand noobs from the rampant rugging and drain scams

Not saying there's no effort, just concerned about how many might hop right back offboard
This is one of the things I‚Äôve read for ages. Beautifully  scribed. I may use this myself sometimes.

Solana-based Crypto Real Estate Platform ‚Äî Parcl**Parcl v3** functions as a perpetuals DEX,  offering real estate index markets for speculation and hedging. Drawing  inspiration from Synthetix perps, the platform introduces scalable  liquidity provision, flexible governance, and robust risk management  features, aiming to ensure stability for liquidity providers (LPs) and  traders. 

 

**Parcl Price Feeds:**  Parcl aggregates public property records, listings, county records, and  transaction history to create a custom valuation index. The Parcl Price  Index, validated through an oracle, represents the median price per  square foot/meter of a given area.

**Wallet Compatibility:**  Built on Solana‚Äôs blockchain, Parcl initially connects with popular  Solana wallets such as Phantom, Solflare, Backpack, with plans for  cross/multi-chain compatibility in the future.

# Earning Points:

The  Program is a mechanism that allows users to accumulate points based on  usage and interaction with the App and services provided therein (‚ÄúParcl  Points‚Äù). The number of Parcl Points earned may vary depending on the  nature of your interaction with the App. Please be aware that Parcl  Points have no cash value, are not exchangeable for cash, and are not  transferable, so we can speculate there might be a token launch. **The lowest-risk investment option**  is to provide stable coin liquidity to the platform with a minimum lock  period of 30 days. This allows you to accumulate points with minimal  risk.

# Maximize points:

When  you refer someone to Parcl, you‚Äôll receive 10% of the Points they earn,  while they enjoy a 5% boost on their Points, forever. It‚Äôs an ideal  opportunity to expand the Parcl community and enhance your rewards.

You can sign up with the wallet, in the app: [https://app.parcl.co/](https://app.parcl.co/)

If you want a 5% boost on the daily earned points, you can add my referral code (klaw24) here [https://app.parcl.co/referrals](https://app.parcl.co/referrals) .
