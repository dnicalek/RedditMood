SOL is the fastest horse in the race I wonder how many people who sold SOL below $10 are now kicking themselves for not holding?  It was scary watching my bag drop 97%, but I still believed in the tech, the build out, and the folks behind it.  Even with all the other FUD out there, with the number of developers and projects working on this blockchain, this alone was a big indicator to stay the course. As a developer myself, I knew the stability issues were going get solved one way or another. WARNING:

I had my average at 19$ and sold at 35$, right before it started pumping ... I've spent too much time on r/cryptocurrency and wanted to offload it, since it got so much negative press around it. You live and you learn I guess.
You make so much money by just inversing that sub, how do people not know this by now ):
I had avg at $14, sold 50% at $50, holding the rest,

Feel dumb enough for that now
Flipped xrp, bnb next.
I am kicking myself because i bought it when it was Higher than it is rn
I did too.  Bought at $68 all the way up to $250 and back down during last bull run.  Then rode it down to > $20 and was DCA'ing the hell out of it then.
When I saw Solana @ $10 all I wanted to do was buy, and I am only kicking myself for not buying more.
Same here.
o solona dont you cry for me.
I sold an NFT for 110 SOL last December and traded it all for MATIC and some other ETH infrastructure plays. Huge regret. But at least I grabbed a bunch at $15 when I realized what was going on. I staked with Jito and made a killing off that.
Whats this pump is about ? Sol is on fire ðŸ”¥
Bunch of news out about on fire adoption.

\- Circle expands EURC stablecoin on SOL blockchain

\- Helium news

\- SOL surpassed ETH in NFT sales

\- SOL surpassed ETH in DEX volume

\- Also likely Blackrock news regarding BTC ETF where they actually buy the underlying asset instead of 'in kind' exchanges.
Letâ€™s mudafuggin gooooo. Iâ€™m in for a good chunk of change @ $45. Ready to ride this wave to 10 or 15x
Bought round 9â‚¬ - their deal with VISA was a real eyeopener!
I sold for >$200 and started buying back around $18. Average is $22ish. Could be worse though.
Same here. Average around 21 and it is now 65% of my bag. It was #3 in my portfolio a few months ago.
Been buying since $4 wooooo
did it hit $4? thought it only briefly dipped below $10 this cycle
Gonna estimate we top out at around $95 in the short term....pullback for a while to $50
If BTC's ETF's pops off in 2-3 weeks, I wouldn't be surprised if SOL breaks ATH by Feb.  But $94 - $95 is at the .618 fib level, so it would be good to have healthy pull back.
Sol has been a 4.5x return for me in my dealings with it directly.  So, pretty sweet.
Solana still heavily undervalued â€¦ compare to inj that did a 40x Solana is chilling and growing as more people love the chain. 

Bullish on solana.
Xrp is a slow horse and sol just overtook them in market cap
I traded 4 eth for sol when it was $18 dollars lmao I'm up like $25k
I round tripped seven figs, doubled down at $8-25, and am up seven figs again.

I get why people capitulated below $10, though.

SOL nearly died and there was a significant chance that it could have become irrelevant.  But, if you used the chain daily (as I and many other people here did), the NFT scene kicked into high gear and the SOL community doubled down and hardened through the ordeal.
Sol is so killer.

1) very nice dex (multiple)

2) cheap trades. I am usually at .1% trade fees. Sometimes more. 

Have you tried to swap on eth ? The gas fees are terrible. And what will ruin eth.

I feel like sol will overtake eth eventually.

Lastly the chain is enjoyable to use. Raydium, orca, Jupiter. All fun. Never on sol do I say I have roo much money on this chain. Always something to do or buy.

you also get banned easy by cuck mods with power tripping god complexes
Nah, you have to go pretty crazy to get banned.
I meant $14, sorry!
haha, fairplay. I got in about $30, was busy stacking ETH LSTs despite swearing blind I'd load up a shit ton below $15
Bro I did the same.

I saw the price at 30 (CAD so 22.5 USD) and had the "huh, might be good to take some while it's cheap it was doing great for a while last cycle." 

Then it shot up to 45$ per SOL (CAD) and then I started looking into the tech more, fell in love with what they were doing and how good it is at addressing the common consumer market rather than the big business market (like ETH is targeting).

Then it shot up again.

Then I looked into the community noticing how much people are gems here compared to other cryptos.

I wish I had more knowledge of SOL last bullmarket and not just seeing it as an ETH competitor.

Still though, was defo stacking ETH blind like you
I'm not really stacking ETH blind, I actively follow the market and I still prefer the long term vision of ETH, but yeah the Sol play was crystal clear when it bounced. Was basically it's $80 ETH moment.   


I'm just glad I wasn't completely sidelined in ETH (although still up 90% so can't complain IG!)
I mainly stacked ETH cause I believe in it's vision, and I think it does really great as well with it's tech and plans. I also believe that it will do great because of how big the network has become. There is competition within it's ecosystem which is a sign of a healthy business/network. Ultimately ETHs future I agree with you, as it was my main stack during the bear market. I do think it still has some kinks to bump out but I also like it. But it doesn't strike me as a network that will be used for the common me and you users, more for businesses as the fee structure is expensive comparatively to SOL which is fast and cheap. 

How I see it ETH has a lot of promise for businesses 
And SOL has a lot of promise for consumer use

But eh, I keep learning and loving both spaces. I do believe that both will have their place in the crypto markets in the future though.

Edit: maybe the term blind I was using it more figuratively than literally (as in tunnel visioning eth)
honestly long term I see modular rollups being cheap enough to kill off the Sol narrative and if/when sol gets saturated it's a lot harder to pivot to modular thesis. 

But short term sol has the edge because it's cheap and fast now, and that's what people want.

I'm not saying Sol will die. But Anatoly talks often about Sol ending up as an L2 to ETH, and that's where I see it heading eventually.

It could well be Sol as an L2 becomes the dominant consumer chain. But it's going to have stiff competition from ARB and OP when they are stage 2 decentralized and also have sub cent transaction costs.
