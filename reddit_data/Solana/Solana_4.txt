$100! We made it! Looking forward to futureI hit a limit to sell 50% of my solana at $100, made a tidy profit, the remaining $500 I have in a GRID bot which trades up and down, it makes me a consistent amount but regretting not just holding instead.

Hope you all made it bigWARNING:

$200 by January 1st?
Yo don't edge me like that bro 😔 (please that'd be amazing)
To add, as I am reading more about Bitcoin halving, the $1,000 mark for Solana becomes more and more realistic. Insane returns for a period of 6 months after halving… plus, if this was any other crypto, I’d say it’s a gamble. But Solana being in Spot #4 and at an affordable price….damn, won’t be affordable for long for sure.
In 2021 it only took 36 days to rise from 100 to 259.
I have been stacking solana the longest time throughout the bear. 

I won’t sell under 1k. 

Solana is going to be amazing , we have not even reached the start of the bull which will be the halving, 109 days away.
🧠🧠🧠
Bought some at 64 and sold at 67 thanks to CC FUD. Big regret but bought some back in at 83…just wish it pulls back a little to stack some more
What makes it 109 days away? I got in when it was about $90 CAD and then averaged down after the FTX stuff so this has been exciting but I’m highly uneducated
lololol i love sol maxi's
Can you explain why Solana’s blockchain won’t crash again and cause a price drop?
Love u my dear solu 🥰
fcking blasting off , let's go !!!
I was the only one of my friends who started buying SOL after the FTX collapse. Almost a year of no gains, and now this. It feels surreal fellas
WOOOOOOOO
Crazy run!
Nice, I'm only down 50% now.
How?? If you DCA'd down during the last couple of months surely you should be back in profit now.
Yo can you tell me more about this GRID bot?
Lfg ladies and gentleman ⛽️
Can you tell me about your grid bot? I’ve always wanted to try this out
Came here to say the same thing. Only got 12 but won’t even consider selling. 

These guys don’t know yet how valuable this stuff really is🔥
103🤑
What's the next resistance? $150?
That oversold RSI worries me a lot. We are heading for max peak to finally to hopefully some kind of cool down. Pumping this hard without retracement is unhealthy.
Injective has already breached 2021 ath. 

I believe in solana ❤️
Well it is not unreasonable to suggest this. $53 to $100 from November 23rd until now (December 23); so perhaps mid-January if the same tempo is kept up. However, usually, in times like this, late comers start jumping all over this and this as a result pushes the price exponentially and much faster.
W explanation. Looks like I'll be copping another one soon.
@Solana_Maximalist I do think you are really onto something here….
First two weeks of January back to ATH you think?
It happens and eth maxis will lose it on Twitter… 

Look at their delusional comments …. 

https://twitter.com/CryptoHayes/status/1738008677360239091
I bought at 30, 15, 10, 14, 18,30,21,14, 24, 30, 40, 66, 77, 64, and my last buy was 90….

R/cc is filled with toxic eth maxis, they fud sol will be 3 dollars, go to 0, etc. 

I will hodl my solana , I believe in solana and its potential to one day flip eth. 

Fire dancer upgrade will be amazing and when that comes Solana will be too expensive for me to afford to buy.
Every single post/comment you make bashes Ethereum. 
Project much?

Both projects are amazing and the future of crypto. You’re right to be high on Sol. Fuck anyone who says otherwise (I’ve stacked Eth since 2017 btw, I love both).

FWIW, my average Sol buy is $47 ish. This shit can run to the Moon and I’ll be a happy man 😂
Bitcoin halving. 

https://www.nicehash.com/countdown/btc-halving-2024-05-10-12-00
Better than an ETH maxi
Hehe I own bitcoin, solana and injective. 

I swapped  my eth for bitcoin due to the toxicity of the eth maxis in early 2023. 

Solana community is growing stronger by the day, we will be all right :)
Again the toxic eth maxi words…. 

If you know firedancer is basically an upgrade to 1 M tps and the code of the solana blockchain will be duplicated in a language other than rust. 

The possibility of both chains going down is near or next to 0.

I know what firedancer will bring to the table and I know what proto dank sharding will bring to eth. 

I am bullish on Solana.
It hasn’t crashed since February 2023. Visa, bank wire transfers, Fidelity and Bitcoin have had down time since Fidelity has. Issues have been resolved via code upgrades.
I bought in 2021.
Previous ath printed in 2021 will come faster than you expect. 

Stay strong fam 💪
ATH this early is impressive 👏
Inj did a 2x actually of previous 2021 ath , it did like a 35x already from lows. 

I own solana and Injective along with Bitcoin. 

Those are my heavy bags from the bear. 

I ain’t selling anything before bitcoin blow off top and altseason and this isn’t my first crypto rodeo. 

I have faith in the cryptos i own 🙏
They are trying to pump Eth instead. Attack SOL since it’s doing well. But with 1M views of that post and SOL price staying strong, I’d argue it’s not working well for them with that scheme.
Solana fam fighting 💪
Were you here end of 2022 early 2023 ? 

Do you know how much hate the solana community received ? 

Till this day the eth maxis are after us. Look at what that babbon Arthur hays is saying 2 days ago ?

I’m going to take a quote from ghandi. 

At first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win. 

Solana will flip eth all right.

https://twitter.com/CryptoHayes/status/1738008677360239091
I was with you and everyone else wondering how much shit SBF was gonna bring onto Solana’s name. 

Eth maxi’s aren’t after you, nor Solana. Self made victim, you’re being. People, including Arthur Hayes, are in this shit to make money. Just like you. Just like me.
Money will be made in all crypto 😎  what's yet to be seen is which will be the biggest winners.

I'm watching INJ chart and didn't do so well on 2021 compared to the others, so you might be right this time they seem to have a good chance to perform.

200 🔜
Wtf is gptsol. Last time I asked OP and they threw words together at me that didn't explain anything.
Honest question that I've been debating for about 3 months now. I want to move all my ADA to SOL. I know diversifying your portfolio is normally better but I mean its kinda hard to ignore the fact I'm holding both of these and one seems to have alot brighter future than the other. Thoughts?
It sounds like you already know what to do
Why should I buy SOL? Update on my decision!After some careful review of input from this community and reading
Firedancer per recommendations from several of you, I have made my decision. 

I decided to consolidate a few under performers and add some dry powder to procure some SOL. 

My decision was made do to my belief SOL has several real world applications, not just potential to make a fast buck.

I was tempted to trade my all my ETH
for SOL, but that will take more time.
My belief that SOL just might overtake ETH was a strong selling point for me.

Best wishes to all of you!WARNING:

It’s like I said yesterday to someone else. Just buy and hold both ETH and SOL. They both have their own qualities and can grow simultaneously.
You are absolutely correct. That is why I didn't move any eth. 👍
Yep, I did the same thing the other day it worked out great
You should definitely leave some ETH. It’s not going anywhere at least any time soon. I moved half of my ETH to SOL. Before this I was BTC and ETH 50/50.
Thank you for the advice.  I am not going to ditch my eth yet. However, I am watching how this is playing out. 😉
welcome to the club 💜
Thank you!  I consider myself on the 
SOL train now. 👍
Sol, Eth and nervos are my safe bags😂
What is nervous if you don't mind me asking?
That's why it is pumping so hard? Lol
Thanks OP!
Glad you did your research brother. Welcome to the comnunity :)
Thank you! And if you read my post yesterday and helped influence my decision, thank you again. 😊
posts like this want to make me take profits
Run it!
You better take at least few % bruv. Fomo is real
The SOL blockchain hasn't crashed since Feb so thats something positive. Its still a very speculative bet but who knows when it comes to SOL. 

I see investing in SOL as a hedge to having Ethereum. Mad not to acquire some SOL and keep your Eth and Btc as well.
My thoughts exactly. Thank you for your input. Best wishes!
I just feel like bad hardware can be fixed if the tokenomics, governance, and management are strong its worth holding onto.
WOOOOOO
Lol! Ok.
Research on firedancer and research on proto dank sharding.

My bet is on solana. ☮️
Been there, done that. It was informative. However, it just grazed the surface for me.
I'm interested in the web3 applications as well as other utilities this coin possesses.
Sol is going to ATH and past it
Such a bold statement.  Convince me.
Is ot a good time to buy in now
It's never a bad day to invest. However, some days are better than others. 🖖
Sol Has been moving fast i was in since the last cycle and grabbed a good amount in the massive dip. Im not gonna say wether it is bad or not to purchase some ATM an investor should know risk tolerance and be able to live with the decisions they make when investing..
One thing I've learned about crypto is that if I stay in the top 10, I never lose as long as I'm willing to wait. 🫡
My sort of thoughts on this is that SOL is making huge moves right now that back up the growth. The phone was a good move, boink was a success, isn't there something with Spotify in the works too? People are going to start selling soon if SOL can't keep riding this momentum but as of now it looks like its making some serious in roads towards becoming a serious, adult crypto
I bought a bunch of $PAW, too
Bro I traded all my eth for sol months ago follow the money
Selling things that haven’t moved yet for something that’s up 10x 🤦‍♂️
No. I traded some bch and usdt. No loss there. I like the fact that sol is web3. Web3 is going to be huge imo. I didn't buy sol for a quick buck. However, I must admit that it's 600% increase got my attention.  I'm a very patient investor.  My patience has rewarded me in the cryptosphere on more than one occasion. 
Best wishes! Oh, and keep stacking. 😉
Ive sold all my btc and sold 30k to go all in solana
Shud have made this decision a while back.. and now you are all in, stay true and enjoy the ride..
For your sake, I hope you did it in January.
Holy fuck. For real. That’s a bold move. What convinced you so much to do such a drastic and daring move?
At these prices?  It’s inflated by meme coins
Cuz you got fomo
No. I got over that shit a few cycles ago.
However, I am human and can fuck up real quick if I make decisions based on emotions rather than research. I try to keep that shit in check. 😉
SOL will increase considering DeFi aspects and his  Layer 1 gas is lower than ETH. A lot of projects are working with about this topic. Probably in 10 years 1 SOL will reach 20K USDs.
That will make a very nice increase or me if it does. I tend to play the long game when it comes to these things. So your prognostication falls in line with my thoughts exactly.  Thank you, friend. 
✌️
I personally would like to see the two kind of integrate that way ethereum can handle the same amount of transaction volume as Solana. However I think realistically what's more likely to happen is Solana is going to completely replace ethereum or it's going to be in all the same places doing all the same things as ethereum but better. I think the only thing ethereum has going left for it now is that it was one of the starting coins. It was the first to get integrated into everything. I don't think it's necessarily going anywhere but I do I do feel like it's going to have to make some changes to keep up with SOL or it's going to get replaced.
My sentiments exactly. 👍
You'd sell your ETH for SOL, but the gas fees to transfer your $100 in eth to an exchange would eat up all your ETH.  Am I right?
You are a fucking genius private Gump! 
Lol. I haven't sold or traded my eth. However, I will drop that shit like a bad habit if I see something I like better. ETH is for moving big money. I like SOL because a poor basturd like me can shuffle my peanuts for the price of the shells. Lol
If you're buying sol might as well get into monkeyhaircut
That's not for me. Saying that it will probably 100x overnight.  🤣 
I hope it works out for you.🖖
This person is a prime example of what’s wrong with society. No one cares. Buy it or don’t. This entire production about your big decision is literally a cry for attention and professional help.
With an attitude like yours, you will go far.
In the toilet. 🤣
Bought after a 10x lol
Yes, I did! And last I checked, it's still moving in that direction. Simpletons such as yourself make assumptions based on your own mistakes and halfass conclusions. 
Next time you decide to comment on a post, do yourself a solid and first read the mother fucker thru completely. 
Have a happy holiday! 😊
You should be out of your mind to buy at this price. This is so overvalued atm.
It's still pumping! 😁
I’m 100% ETH but debating about putting like 25% into SOL. I know ETH will make some major gains this coming year with the ETFs, but there could be bigger gains made in SOL. Then I’d sell SOL and get back into ETH.
Agreed. I believe ETH is way undervalued right now with it not folllwing the BTC news pump as Eth etf approval. The fact it’s under 3k right now shocks me. But SOL is the cheaper, more efficiency direct competitor to ETH. So I’ve also gotten into SOL in last year bc of that and a clear 5-10x potential short term compared to ETH 2x over longer term. And it just made #5 on MC list. Blew by xrp only upside from here
Because you can buy $JUPY on radium I use Solflare wallet
Question: how many solana’s do you need to be a millionaire in the 2029 bull run?
I doubt anyone in the galaxy can answer that question accurately.  However, I get the feeling you may have an answer. So, how much? Lol
Bought 70 solanas at 20$ so i am happy so far
I have flipped my last ounce of eth today .. u can always flip back
I try not to flip flop. It fucks with my bottom line too much.
CKB , “nervos network”
Pardon the typo. My devise has a mind of its own. Lol  So, CKB=nervos. Thanks for the 411.
I thot he was joking that he was also nervous all this time so much so that he has a bag of it. Lol!!!
Solana is a black hole , sucking in many dapps and services that are previously eth exclusive. 

Stablecoin is one metric. 

https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/12/22/paxos-solana-ethereum-department-financial-services-stablecoin-circle-tether/amp/
Thanks for the heads up! 🫡
It just 5x while other Altcoins did 2-3x max and we're not even past the halving yet. Solana has established itself as a strong and promising competitor to Ethereum and other Layer 1s after perservering through multiple black swans and the bear market 22/23. If nothing catastrophic happens, and by that I mean lights-out level catastrophic, Sol is going to continue attracting developers, businesses/apps which in turn will expand the userbase.

Assuming the entire crypto market keeps growing as it has in the past, Sol, like any other serious project in the space, will smash its ATH during the next bull run.

Ofc this entire space is still mostly speculative, which is why such volatility is possible in the first place. Huge upside, huge downside.
Bonk helped
Yes indeed & i have been thinking to buy it from the times it was 87$ but i didnt & now i dont know if there will be a slightly correction & the price will drop a bit so i can enter with a good price or shall i just go all in now
If I could answer that question, I wouldn't be here. I'd be chatting to you from the French riviera. Lol
Thats sort of where I'm at too I bought SOL at $30 per coin and monkey brain says 'its only worth $30 per coin' so I have a hard time buying more.
💪🏽💯
Rock on brother, or sister! Hard to tell with the wardrobe these days. Lol 👊
Best of luck to you! I got in SOL last December around $10. Have added a little throughout the year but wouldn’t dare add any now until a significant dip. At some point soon the entire market will correct by 40% until the next leg up.
weird because you‘ve posted on the solana subreddit 2 years ago. why do people lie online? does it make you feel better?
I know..fuck it.
I just started getting into crypto this past spring. I went all in SOL first but let my manager talk me into putting some money into XRP with the SEC stuff, newbies gunna listen to people who have been in the game. SOL did better after the ruling than XRP did. Should have just trusted my instincts lol
Just did it last two days
Wow! You got a big set of balls! Lol. I'm praying it goes our way. 👍
Yea but you didn't think about it a month  ago and researching now cyz fomo 🤣🤣
Like I said in my above post. The 600% got my attention, not my money. I like the web3 aspects of this coin. It has huge long term potential imo. I'm too old and maybe a little too wise to be casing money. I take a more relaxed position and let it come to me.
Thanks for the observation though, even if it is a bit near sighted. 😉
Why cant they all coexist?  Why should there only be 1 winner?
Each coin has its own strengths and weaknesses. Some become obsolete as others evolve. It's survival of the fittest. 
SOL may lay ETH to rest. Only time will tell.
Happy Holidays!  🫡
Why don't we still use flip phones or blackberries any more?
I moved half my ETH bag into SOL back when it was $12.  Have to admit that I do feel like a genius.  Depends on your portfolio percentages, but shifting fractions of your holdings to ones with more potential, if you believe in them after your research, seem like a no brainer.
You, my friend, sound like a wise investor. 
I follow a similar philosophy. I only risk profit, not principle. 

See you at the top! 🫡
Fair enough 🚀🙏
Wow- we got a sensitive one here
Lol!  You are a real gem! 😉
Yeah that's exactly the reason!  you can't jump in a moving train. İf you already have it good for you. But don't follow the hype. 
Moves like this prehalving is artificial and unsustainable. And usually a signal of blow off top.
I would have loved to see it sooner. However, I'm in it now. I'm a long hauler, so if it tanks, no sweat. I have other irons in the fire that keep me fed.
I actually haven’t a clue. I’m new to crypto trading. I bought a few solanas last month around 45 bucks each and I’m holding. So far seems to me solana is slowly but surely exiting the altcoin club and will be joining the BTC and ETH club to be the third amigos. If BTC ETF gets approved and solana gets an ETF also in the future while considering how things are going for it, I don’t see why can’t it head close to at least 1000. I’m so new so any input and correction regarding what I said would be appreciated!!!
I don't give financial advice. I am here to learn the same as you. I'm sure there are many on this sub willing to help you. However, many of those are here to help themselves. 🤔
Be careful out there!
I only invest some very few coins which I strongly believe, they may go down, it comes up stronger, SOL was $260 in 2021, I hade some then and it went down so low, I loaded more and now my average is $22.93, glade I bought a lot more when it was $23.36. Btw- I am up 325%..
Nice bro that’s a good average SOL for life 🚀🚀 my average is pretty low as well.
I did well with a few others. I'm trying to diversify with a little of the proceeds. Not trying to get rich quick. I like playing with crypto. It's so much easier than some other assets I've dealt in.  It's also an opportunity for me to learn something new.  Like web3. I'm the type of person that doesn't pay close attention to something unless I have something to lose. Thats why I got into crypto in the first place. I look forward to learning about sol and its utility, as well as profit from my experience.
Anytime mate.

You are confused. Maybe you should put your head in gear and check your calendar before you make another false accusation. 
I personally would look at someone's reddit birth date before I made a complete dumbass statement such as yours. 🤔
are you high? i didn‘t reply to you but to the other user. his account is 3 years old. maybe you should smoke a bit less before writing dumb comments brother.
Lie??
Im 23 thats little more than half of my savings….in this life everything is made to keep us poor.so i take the risk.my friend put 50k from his line of credit on solana now up 40k…i hope its my turn
I'm praying for us bro! I wouldn't have committed that much % of my pile at this point. However, I like the way you move, bro. No balls! No blue chips! As they say.
🤑
Let's just hope SOL doesn't mean "shit out of luck!"    LMAO 🤣
I think the comparison is not accurate.  It is like saying only iphones or samsung androids can win while there are so many other smart phones that are thriving in the world.
I know 😊
I'm gonna upvote you. I like people that fuck with me. Down deep, you're probably pretty cool. For an asshole that is. Lol
Look! Here's your upvote fucker. Lol
My strategy is to invest big on very solid ones, like BTC, Eth and now SOL too, price may fluctuate, like the recent BTC drop from $68k to $20k’s, but they always go up, do not put greed over your strategy, keep holding and think long term always. Short term gains may not be the best investment strategy in my opinion. When I started crypto I keep on buying anything that pump and create hype, thought I will make profit but I lost so much money. Cause some them still stays low and there’s always the risk of losing all. My biggest loss was Luna, I lost almost $30k on Luna crash.
Luna was nasty, I was very lucky to not have invested a significant amount. Main reason at the time being, that I had no money left over to invest.
Contrary to what my profile name may imply, I do not use cannabis in any form.
However, I am definitely pro pot. Now, as far as your rude comment goes, perhaps you should go stand in the corner like a good little bitch. 🫡
rude comment? apart from the weed, i was right. who‘s the little bitch here? nice mental gymnastics bro.
Yes!! When eth was 2-3$ and went to 200$-250$ people were panicking and saying sell sell it has go up immensely but now…look at eth price.
So for sol.oh no its at 127$(cad) you should sell? Lol i am all in.it goes up by only 20-30$(wich in sol case is not much) i will make already 10k profit
In my opinion 🤷‍♂️
Happy for you friend.  I'm gonna hold out for a untill it hits 2k before I make any decisions.  Don't catch cold up there! Lol
Scared money don’t make money, as they say. Often times the ability to make life changing money requires making bold moves.
You're right. However, once one becomes successful, a smart investor will remove the principle and play with the profit. For me, that philosophy has worked well for over 3 decades. The only time I got in trouble was when I deviated from that rule.
😉
This is very true, also if your greed overtakes, you make stupid mistakes..
You are most certainly welcome.  I'm more than happy to help another human being pull his head out of his ass. ✌️
Oh im not selling trust me my deadline is end 2025 then 🫡
Why do you think it will hit 2k.  I mean should I just hold tight and keep accumulating?
I have no idea of when or if the price will rise or fall. I was simply trying to convey that I have no plans on selling or trading anytime soon.  My reason for buying in was not based solely on profit in mind. I bought SOL because I wanted to learn more about it. I tend to pay more attention to something that I have a stake in. I know this may sound strange, but it serves me well.
For sure. One of the biggest mistakes  investors make is not having a profit taking strategy.
No, you have made a good point.  I'd rather be like you than me when it comes to finances.  I have butter fingers when it comes to money 🤭🤗!!!
