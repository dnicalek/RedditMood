Thinking about bridging my project to SolanaI'm part of the dev team for moontropica and I'm thinking about getting off eth and going to solana. The community here seems so much better and functionality of solana is so much better for in-game transactions. Is there any other benefits I'm missing?WARNING:

Welcome to Solana.

>functionality of solana is so much better for in-game transactions

With Solana you'll be making things you'll never be able to do in ETH.

Considering the fast, super cheap transaction on Solana, you may implement many more features in your game that are costing a lot on ETH chain.

So more transactions, more utility for whatever feature or in-game transactions you have there.
That's actually awesome. We do have a lot of transactions happening. My original concern with solana when I was looking at chains to build on was solana would go down once in a while. I'm assuming that has been Improved?
Beware of being jeeted. Almost all projects without huge influ connections and marketing wallet are rugged by jeets from far south Asia with their 3 $ wallets
Is it possible to write smart contracts on Solana using solidity?
I think that's what a project called Neo does.
Please consider KIN-SPL as well...
I see a lot of misinformation out there so dyor. Imo things are improving but the popularity of solana is also exploding. Volumes for certain metrics have surpassed eth. Also for improvements look into firedancer.
That was a problem before but it's been solid without going down for almost a year now I think
That was happening in 2022 because of a known issue. 3 updates fixed it.
First Ripple, now Solana is getting fake, AI-generated YouTube ads. Due diligence people!WARNING:
