Huge Player Retention on this Casual Cross-Chain, Gasless Moonbeam Game on Polkadot! - NFT NomadGame isn't playable on my S23 ultra. I downloaded the game, but every time I launch it to play it gives me an error that my version is outdated and that I need the latest apk.

I click update in-game, but the version on Play Store just says "Play", with nothing to update.
Well that is a gasless experience for sure! Sorry for the lame joke, I'm all for polkadot xD
I lawled, thanks!
