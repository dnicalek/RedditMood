Anyone else throw tiny amounts at parachain?I did, most of my parachains received 5-10 polkadot so the rewards I got were quite small. I wish I would have just researched and dumped it all in just one or two but it prob would have been Acala. It is what it is but a lot of these parachains don't really hold enough to matter or worth transferring to sell. Long story short, if I'm going to pick 1-3 para's to consolidate to what should I pick? I'm leaning towards Aster and Clover (although I wish I understood how clover interacts with both etherium and polkadot) but not sure what I should do with my 3rd, polkadex?
