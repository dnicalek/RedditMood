 â €XRP volume soars - Theories?Since the end of December, payments from one accounts to another on the XRPL have absolutely soared, and maintained a level of 5.5m-5.8m PER DAY (see https://xrpscan.com/metrics).

Anyone know why? Any theories? This seems huge but I haven't seen any credible explanations.I think it's due to this

Haha, yeah I had a Google after I posted this.. well, at least it's a good network stress test!
Just jumped on Coinbase and they are saying Xrp is available now. I don't know when that got actively relisted on Coinbase, but that could be one reason why the surge.
Addressing the recent FUDHello everyone. I know that itâ€™s 2024 and there has been a lot of fud around XRP and itâ€™s potential. My solution to you to keep from selling your bag in fear is to just take a small amount every month and lock it up in escrow until 2026. This isnâ€™t financial advice, but just from what I know (over 20 years in the financial markets sector) take it or leave it.What FUD? All I'm seeing is business as usual
Sell.  I bought xrp for misery and it did not disappoint.
Sec is so corrupt they will delay it as much as they can
You didn't really address any fud here. This post can be summarised as, "I know stuff, don't sell".
You are not really adressing the fud though.
Youâ€™re right, but you canâ€™t sell if itâ€™s locked in escrow. You will thank me later.
How do you lock up XRP in escrow?? Isnâ€™t that something Ripple does?
You can lock it up as well, use XRP toolkit, you lock it up in your own escrow
Anyone can create an escrow
Whatâ€™s the fud this time?
Bitcoin spot ETF *might* not be approved.
The fud is the IRS. This is USA though. 

I don't know if this mean 10k in one transaction, 10k in one month, or 10k total this year.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) now requires anyone who receives at least $10,000 in cryptocurrencies to report transaction information to the IRS. This includes the name, address, and Social Security number (SSN) of the sender, as well as the amount, date, and nature of the transaction.
Itâ€™s for one transaction. Right?
Donâ€™t marry your coins, follow the money, I learned the hard way. SEC will hold back XRP till 2026 then it will rip in 2029
Sell everything on the next 5th bull run? Take profits ðŸ“ˆ because that's what smart players do? It's once every 4 years this happens, btw..it actually reminds me of my bday.. leap year..cash out and rebuild once it's settled? Nothing ever goes up forever?
That still has 0 to do with adressing the fud.
Your title sucks.
Interesting.  Is there any benefit to doing that?
I suppose it just forces you to hold and not panic sell or sell to early (as if you could know) or have paper hands. Downside would be if it hits a big number you canâ€™t sell it. Not going to do this myself.
It won't. The SEC suddenly has no time to deal with it.
I'd assume so just like the money laundering law reporting cash above 10k but it could mean aggregate I guess but that's less likely
48c guyHe was right you were wrong so who got the last laughIâ€™m more impressed by the one who sold yesterday, excellent timing!
That was me
Me, but not all of them. There's another rise coming.  There are a lot of well-known investors  who are in XRP. Their verbiage is Holdl, buy low.  So, I believe that we are good
Thanks for the post.  I hadn't been watching it and saw this.  My limit order was filled.
You S.O.B. YOU DID IT!!!! CONGRATS ðŸŽ‰
Congrats 48 center! Youâ€™re as much a celebrity as David and Brad in my book!
Some many people were bashing the 48c guy in this group, and turned out to be wrong. Never be too complacent.
The exact point I am trying to make ðŸ’¯
Somebody is going to tattoo 48c guy's username, if I remember correctly. I demand a picture of it
I wanna see this too lmao
I haven't worked out all of the details on how it will be designed but 4 digit XRP and I tattoo a girl (a decorated XRP angel) mooning the moon and had ideas of adding more to it like how you see people take pics with hands up like they are holding the moon...something elaborate like that and somehow have XRP or rockets or I don't know what else yet.  Figured if I actually get to doing it, I'll be putting in a bunch more research and consulting artists to get ideas before doing it.
Who is the 48c guy?
Nobody has the last laugh. 

It's all our own decisions, he ultimately missed put on a potential buy at the local top.

I don't care who buys or sells at whatever.
Just DCA and chill.... or not....
The point is you all chastise him for his strategy that worked for him because it didn't fit you
Was he though? ðŸ˜‚
We hit 48 and he said we would and I agreed so ya he was...
I am still buying the dip ðŸ˜‚
Your in the hall of legends now dude! 

What's the next prediction? Or is it better to retire and hold the title ðŸ˜…
If we reject 44k then we could fall to about .30 where our value area low is. But that would likely take btc etf approval delay or denial and possibly the housing market to crash.

If we can hold 44k, then we are likely moving to 50-53 to fill the bear market beginning gap. At that point we will want to watch for rejection as well, but again it would take a bit at this point.
But did 48c guy buy back his bag? maybe / maybe not
Yes, I got it all back plus the target increase I was looking for.
Is this 48c guy burner account?
Nope just someone who saw exactly what he saw and is laughing about the hypocrisy of this sub that bashes those who seek to help.
Nice try 48 cent guy!
Was he though? My Chart showed it bottomed at 49

If his order was set on coinbase he didn't hit....yet
Inder.47 here
* Insert "If those kids could read" meme here *
Price dipped to exactly 50c so not quite.

##Whereisurlambo?
I don't need to impress people so I will never buy one
Worst project held for 5 years now. Itâ€™s such a joke.
Then sell and get something else
The real truth we can not know! In my opinion. The whales tell you to put 5% stop losses. Then they carry out the weak hands. They make money on volatile market! Push people out and before you know it is back up to .60 or where ever you are forced to get back in before fomo sets in.find a way to be strong and smart! I don't have the secret sauce. Good luck to all.
The signs were there and I saw it as well
Entry 65.49 Long LTC to 0.69c 5x lev. 0.48cent guy here GL
Get on that guy that's supposed to get the tattoo I bet he will try to find a way out of it.
Crypto market as a whole took a hit, already going back up who cares
The point is you all chastise someone for having commitment just because you didn't want to believe what was possible. Just wait until your waiting for some crazy number and your warned you won't get there and forced to hold or sell at a loss.
He is only right if he had a limit buy placed, and it got filled.
Price hit 48 and he said it would that would be an accurate projection that we could still revisit. If you crash your car and the airbag goes off the speed of the airbag deploying has nothing to do with the outcome. I get not many people got to buy at that price, but I can guarantee those that did were not in this sub.
Weâ€™re fixing to see God candle
If you say so. I see otherwise.
How was he right?
The candle that hit below 48 cents....
2017 people that bought sub .20 and didn't sell during the mega run over here wondering what yall are making a big deal about....
I sell high and buy low I'm not one of the morons
They are not an XRP investor. XRP is part of their portfolio.
23c incoming.
I don't see anything that would support much lower than 38 or 30 if the whole market tanked again and met previous lows.
Bummer dudeeeee
Of course an XRP investor would encourage people to hold. What else would you expect them to say?
Thanks!  There were times I questioned the move but let it play out on the $.48 limit buy.
I think it might be dangerous to do that again, though

Awesome self-discipline.  Kudos
Damn dudeâ€¦.keep sucking him up. Make sure you clean around your mouth when youâ€™re done as well.
I hope you get left holding with that mentality. It will be nice to buy your coins when you sell at a loss.
I didn't do nothing and nor do I care.

I've heard all this "last chance at this price" on multiple coins and stocks. within a few weeks it's lower than said price.
I'm talking about this sub as a whole. It spent months talking shit that it would never happen and now that it did, you have people saying it didn't or it won't matter. They could have gotten a decent entry waiting for .48 over .60. I never said any last chance to buy, but buying at the projected dips is a better way to DCA imo, rather than randomly tossing money at something.
I mean there are so many catalysts ahead. I'm not even looking until all the legal shit is done for.
It wicked down to 53 not 48

Holy crap itâ€™s you
49 on cb the only one that matters
If you were on Coinbase your limit orders were probably not triggered and if you tried to sell market you would have probably ran into issues. Coin base is a horrible exchange to make moves on when the market is moving, this happens time and time again and has for years. As one guy commented on another thread earlier this morning

> Why the heck canâ€™t I sell my XRP???? Iâ€™m on coinbase
I already did. Happy now.
Lol I forgot about that guy, they always hide ðŸ˜‚ also Iâ€™ll show you my profits on this Ltc trade tomorrow or thought whenever it hits
Good luck, I do not see much positivity currently, so manage risk properly.
Donâ€™t say you all and group everyone into something for the actions or comments of a fewâ€¦check my messages I donâ€™t say anything but I been in crypto since 2017 and investing for over 15 years and even the stock market took a hit it wasnâ€™t directly related to anything just XRP so calming peopleâ€™s nerves downâ€¦unfortunately thereâ€™s too many whiney new investors that overreact to things and I been there beforeâ€¦if you believe in the utility and the mission ripple has for it then stop looking at current price unless you are a short term investor
If you don't care about price then don't comment on posts about price if it doesn't matter
If I recall correctly. 48cents guys said he sold to rebuy at 48 cents. 


My initial statement stands.
I have a car to sell you it's not totaled
What do you see
Oh I didnâ€™t even notice, nice!
Wish I had a limit order for myself around .5 so it would fill but oh well, I got to roll some profits back in either way.
I agree.  Honestly I feel like I got lucky this time.  Previous times felt more calculated and worked out in a much shorter time span.
You can hold deez nuts with that negative mentality.
You would need a pair first that's why your here bashing someone that tried to help because you hate you.
Sir, this is Reddit. Talking shit is par for the course.
Why you think I'm laughing at everyone of these people in denial and blasting them back. At least my bashing isn't baseless
That's called the general you. Wow
What are the upcoming catalyst?
Interesting, then shit , he was right ðŸ˜‚
Nah I just pulled it out of my ass for the hell of it
$0.50 on Binance. 

So, it only worked if he had an order ready on a smaller exchange. I bet if he had we would've heard about it by now, lol.
My limit order was on Kraken.  When I saw this post I checked coinmarketcap and $.53 was the lowest reflected.  I was like, Ha? Checked Kraken anyway and the order was filled.
why is it so different on the platforms? 
bitstamp all time low 24h is ,553$
When a group related to XRP information and informative discussions becomes nothing more than unintelligent morons like yourself that are probably 20 years old investing every penny from their life savings into a crypto and not diversifying so all they do is cry and troll itâ€™s hard not to jump in and try to settle some nervesâ€¦but keep whining on message boards and acting tough instead of actually contributing something constructive for all XRP holders to look forward tooâ€¦and go fuck yourself
This guy is clearly missing the point lmao
