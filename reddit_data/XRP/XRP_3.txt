 ‚†ÄWhen Lambo?Seeing al these post lately  I thought I'd make a contribution as well.Well I thought we'd see a leg up to the .80s within the last couple weeks so who knows. Not me apparently. 

Anyways, Lambo 3rd Week of January. 1000%
It does kinda suck seeing everything else booming up. Al tho it hasn't been preforming badly the past year.
What‚Äôs happening the 3th week of January?
Honda right now
Unfortunately not an NSX.
‚Äò92 civic
Lam bambo?
Bam Bam
2589
*Owns Lambo, but earned it in other cryptotrades.
ü§£
2030
So does it matter how much I put in, or is it just lambo at 2030 anyway?
No Lambo for you
Damn, was kinda looking forward driving something more recent than 2005.
More like a gently used Honda Metro scooter
Well it did just go up a full 1% well get there ü§£
Is going to 10,000 xrp
So small lambo?
Is going to be next bitcoin
I can probably afford a 2014 4Runner with 100k miles rn
It's a start tho haha
SPECIALIZED BIKE HERE üòÇüòÇüòÇ
We're all ( special here ) ü§£
When XRP hits .48 a God candle will follow the likes the crypto space has not experiences before .
Probably, I'm really curious where it's going to be 10 years from now.
Sheeeet. When Honda civic would be dope too üòÇ
A used one right? ........right?
When. 90 cents?
My guess, next week.
Let‚Äôs focus on wen dollar for now
Just looked at the charts, did some calculations. And al you'd need is like 400000xrp at a dollar.
Why lambo?
Why no lambo ?
Koenigsegg
I hope soon. Need to run up to 90 like solana
2050
Lada ok?
Isn‚Äôt a cybertruck faster?
Wen Prius Prime?
Alright, Slow down there, money isn't you're problem mate it's taste. ü§£
Honestly, I was just being completely random. But I can come up with a reason for anything...

Right now crypto as a whole feels very "Flavor of the month". Right now it's Solana but I feel like that's slowing. The criticisms are starting to rise to the top again. Early January will probably be all bitcoin ETF. Later January / Feb perhaps we back into the conversation of functionality and real utility. SEC things being completely done will be on the visible horizon (before end of 2024, my guess is early-mid Q3). Close enough to start driving volume and speculation.
dont matter how much
Well let's hope so üòâ
Waste of money. You‚Äôll just be broke but have a high maintenance luxury car. Think long term
I actually wouldn't ever buy a lambo haha.
Buy a replica for 10% of the price ü§£
Looking to keep my money stagnant, or lose some for tax purposes. How much xrp should I buy?I hate making money, figured I'd get into xrp. How much should I buy if I'd like to lose at least 5k?I really think since you spend time helping others like yourself with their own addictions, perhaps a good way keeping a focus on that part of your life to help you maintain your surrender you could donate 5k to your local group for coffee or coffee cakes? or whatever it is you eat there, the donation will be good for your taxes, you may make some new friends like you, and when you fall back off please do your best to mange yourself, you are loved, never forget that, whether you are stagnant, or at the bottom of your bottle just remember my words here when you find yourself at your lowest and you need some encouragement to not continually fall victim over and over and over and over again to your own weaknesses, whether hardwired genetic from poor choice breeding of your ancestors, or learned coping mechanisms due to you being you or whatever, think of me when that first taste touches your lips, I am rooting for you! No, we‚Äôre all rooting for you!!
Dang bro!! Loving and supportive takes all the fun out of a shitpost!! Thought this would be a fun spin on how much to become a millionaire. Not the internet (especially Reddit) way!!
So fucked up‚Ä¶.
Wait and buy at 5usd
All of it.
My thoughts exactly
No doubt this is the right decision!! You wont have any trouble making that money stay in the same spot for the rest of time!
Get monero aswell
Facts. Every time I buy XRP, the price always goes down‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like they are targeting me.
Me 2 !!
Think they are always targeting me  !!
Well putting 5k in XRP right now, isn't a wise move to lose 5k

Unfortunately you wouldn't lose it, you'd double it easily. 

Maths (uk calculations)
XRP sitting at .49

I put 5k in.

It reaches just 1.00. I've just earned 10k

If it reaches 2.50 which its highest. You would get 25k

If it reaches 10.00, which is possible once the court case finishes. Youve just bagged yourself 100k  

The risk for xrp is so low, you cant actually lose.


Solana. Put your 5k in there. It goes up to 100 per solana. Your only getting  6741 for that effort. 

If it reaches its 189 mark again your only getting 12k.

If it has a dip by just 10.00, your out of pocket. 

Bitcoin is even worse both ways, with little movement either way can make you nothing worth it but the same movement backwards your 5k has gone. When your working with 1000s and even 100s the risk is greater without little reward unless your putting in 10000s.

Easy way to lose go put it on gold for 15mins haha easily lose it in minutes hahaha
Aaaaahahaha this is perfect
How to make 5k lose value over time due to inflation. Put in XRP. It'll move so little that it would not beat inflation and as such you will have less over a 20 year period. Also there's a good chance the price of XRP price will be at $0.45 by then so you'll be sure to have even less money. Hope this helps.
mayor of yapsville over here
Do you know what xrp has gone through, why and what it is trying to achieve? 
Cause anything that the whole banking system will use, isn't going to suddenly go up in price before the legislation and legal framework is clarified. That would just be stupid.
As much as you're willing to lose
I would buy as much as you can risk. You shouldn't lose. Xrp has been held back by the sec. It has many, many banks and other financial services it has partnered with.
Its price in the future will be much higher than today.
Facts. The industry momentum it has built is undeniable and they have made serious in-roads with banking bigwigs. No brainer tbh.
Hahaha, hilarious üòÇüòÇ
sell your dog, go all in
You're kidding right lol
I‚Äôve passed $5K into XRP.  I already lost $30K in $AMC.
You should buy as much as $5k will get you. At a minimum. If you‚Äôre feeling extra spicy, buy $10k worth.
Stay

Hahahhahahahahahauauauuauahahahaha nice one mate
Is XRP spot ETF the next big move for Wall Street?What exactly is a ‚ÄúSpot‚Äù and ‚ÄúETF‚Äù? Or is it specifically ‚ÄúSpot ETF‚Äù? 

Can some one help explain?

And why is a spot etf important to the ecosystem of crypto?
ETF is Exchange-traded-Fund, which is a collection of assets that is tradable. Spot means that the etf represents for example bitcoin, and all the bitcoin sold with the etf are needed to be bought from the market and are in custody of the etf provider. so the spot etf is comparable with wrapped bitcoin on eth chain for example, is no real btc but represents it. So the wrapped bitcoin on wall street for example are much more accessible for institutional investors, as etfs have clear rules and are assets also often being bought by institutions. Those big investors are key for more liquidity and exposure to big projects.
They will probably announce that they will never do a XRP spot ETF and the price will dump to 30 cents. It's just the XRP way.
There is no appetite for a xrp spot etf.
ETH SOL then the rest.  It will happen in 2024 for XRP though.  Just my opinion.
No chance of that happening whilst the lawsuit is ongoing
Oh man. Correct me if I derail here. 
It sounds like x(crypto) spot etf would be available to invest in publicly traded exchanges such as the stock market? That would be huge for any crypto 

Thinking(typing) outloud‚Ä¶ that would make sense why large companies have invested into bitcoin and have pushed to add bitcoin to spot etf? I believe in saying it right?
