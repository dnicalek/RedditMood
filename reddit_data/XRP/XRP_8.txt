 ‚†ÄStarted building my home thanks to XRP.As the tittle says, thanks to XRP I been saving money I. XRP since half 2023.

Has most people here don't know here in Argentina taxes, inflation and market control are destroying the common worker monthly income, mine right now it's 208.000$ ARS, (215 USD monthly) for a 6 hour shift in a call center.


Since the pandemic the government prohibited me from buying DOLLARS because I received a small bonus and sleep from the government when I was working in a small company. 

With an inflation of 1.20% daily things are super hard right now and my only way of saving my money it's putting it on XRP .


Today I managed to buy the first roof sheets I need for the house me and my gf are trying to build!

Things sometimes get hard and difficult to come out with but with crypto and XRP in my case it will be a bit easier.Wish you the best man!
Thanks! Hope we can finish it in 1-2 years atleast making it a decent place to sleep .
The prospect of inflation is what got me looking for things to put my cash in to, back in 2020. Good luck with your house!

How is Milei so far in your opinion? Do you think his policies will help you in your situation?
I think Milei is doing was must be done, I voted for him everytime, I was born during a economic crisis and been living like that for 27 years right now, and in tired for seeing the same corrupted faces stealing everything and destroying the country. His policies are perfect for  Argentina a place where u can make money everywhere u just need the will to do so
215$ a month is crazy what is the average cost of a meal? 

Is this also 6 hours 5 days a week?
Well, that depend on what you want to eat and where.
You can eat a milanesa (meat steak covered like a nugget) with smashed potatoes for around 6000$ Ars (5.80 USD) and you can feed a family of 4 with that (1 kg of meat and 2 of potatoes)

If you go for a dinner outside a McDonald's combo it's around 5000$ ARS, 4.90 USD. Today I got paid 230.000$ ARS for my monthly salary.
All the best, you are doing great.  My only recommendation is to diversify a bit, don't put all the eggs in one basket.  one month buy XRP, the next month buy something else, and so on.
I'm doing it! I registered myself in world coin too.. I know it's a bit shady but the money worth it here... And in between buying XRP, BTC and eth
Viva la libertad carajo
You got this man! And congrats!!
Thanks so much!
This needs to be its own subreddit ‚ÄúHouseofXRP‚Äù - I‚Äôd love to see how you get on heck you might even get some xrp donations as a result
I appreciate when someone like you gives me perspective. Wishing you the best. Keep pushing forward.
Dang man best of luck and congrats
Good luck with everything Man
Thanks! Going to keep pushing! Hooping someday everything gets better here and I can reach this dream with my gf.
I wish you the best for you and your girlfriend and maybe your future family. Even if I'am a french football supporter haha ! Just kidding. I truly believe the XRP Army will be granted for this bet on the future.

Things are putting themselves in place slowly. Just wait for the end of the trial with the SEC in the USA, and it will be one of the rare legal crypto in the us. And cash will flow ! and moon
We are planning of having babies but no now... The situation isn't the best,  I hope too XRP can go much higher in the near future.
Keep grinding fam üíØüíØ
Good luck!
Muy buena suerte compatriota, te deseo lo mejor para vos y tu familia! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Muchas gracias! Espero apesar de todo poder seguir adelante, nos estamos privando de todo poco un tiempo pero por una buena raz√≥n
sure you didüôÑ
Let us know when the next house party is!
Wow, that's awesome. It's amazing to see how crypto, especially XRP, is making a difference in people's lives, even in challenging economic situations.   
Have you ever thought about staking your XRP? It could be worth considering! 

Staking often provides a much higher Annual Percentage Yield (APY) compared to traditional banks (however it's worth noting that token price fluctuations affect interest rates, where banks, on the other hand, may offer more stable interest rates). It's a trade-off to consider in your savings strategy. Still, it's all about finding the right balance for your financial goals!   
(Not financial advice and remember to always DYOR)  
Keep hustling and best of luck! üí™üöÄ
Be careful bro. Nothing is guaranteed
In this man‚Äôs case 1.2% daily inflation rate is guaranteed. I were faced with that bs I‚Äôd rather hold anything other than Argentinas currency. 

With that said, cheap transaction costs, instant settlement and no surprise 200% gas fee like eth, XRP def seems like his best option. 

I‚Äôd also look into USDC on Stellar as a more stable option to remove yourself from risk of volatility as well OP. At least until USDC comes to the xrpl. Just a thought.
you make $1000 per week in argebtina? you are rich compared tothers.

$200 per shift is really good.
Sorry didn't clarify, it's per month the shifts y 5 days 6 hours a week
If you put it in solana you would have a mansion
Guy is literally struggling to build a roof over his head, facing some of the worst financial conditions in the world, and you use this post to root for your favorite coin and tell him he could have done better.  You are the absolute definition of a piece of fucking shit and you should take a moment to realize what the fuck you just wrote.
Good luck with the house ..let everyone know when you're finished and moved in
And send pics if you can too!
Wait till you find out about Monero
uhhh no im pretty sure hitler is worse
What was his portfolio like?
I will do when we start setting up ! Today I bought the 6 roof sheets and next month going for the woods to make the frame!
Just sold my XRPYeap, that's right after six years of holding XRP, I'm just about to sell 85% of my tokens. For me, I can live for the future promise or use that investment in almost any other alt coin and turn that investment into something. 

Let me explain: if I had invested $1000 one year ago in BTC today I would have made $1687 on top. If I invested $1000 in XRP I would have made $860. 
That's almost 50% less than I would have made if invested in BTC. 

No one truly knows when XRP will raise, but I would have expected something by now. I hate sitting here watching paint dry.thank you for your sacrifice
What‚Äôs funny is the jokes on both of you
Sacrifice for what? I've been in this space for years and remember people saying XRP to $593 or whatever. I dropped this coin back in 2019 and never looked back and never regretted it.
This is why you don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket.
I got a basket full of xrp eggs, with one complete eth token in my pocket ü§£
Totally agree, my portfolio consists of stable coins, risky coins and painfully messed up coins (Luna being the worse losses).
62 cent guy.
I can't wait for $62 guy
You beat me to it.
ROI has been very poor.
ROI from coins bought 1.2.2023 @ 0.34 if sold today 1.2.2024 @ 0.63 is an 87% gain. 

Is 87% considered a very poor ROI these days? And if so, for those of you that think this, are you invested in stocks, funds,  bonds or real estate? And how would you categorize your gains in those?
That's the point, we've had a few stale years across crypto on a whole, and the BTC halving this year will blend across the market. So, I'll examine other investment opportunities and probably slide back into XRP where it'll probably have moved to 0.67c.
Starting to see numerous posts like this. Bullish
Lmao xrp hodlers been bullish for years.
Selling right before a huge bull run seems like a poor idea
That's what they said years ago
üíØ
I‚Äôm not going to disagree with the guy, it‚Äôs been a painful road, but it does seem like an odd time to bail after holding 6 years.
Not if he exchanges it for BTC. Could be a great idea honestly. No one knows‚Ä¶
85% of Gamblers quit before hitting it big
How many goodbye threads are we going to get?


We should now have a new flair...
Lol cool man üëçüèª
I also bought in 2017. It sucks
Another soldier lost
ü§£ü§£ rest easy brother RIP
I picked up his bag today.   Along with many others.
Come back with an update in a few months‚Ä¶
Nice.  Never understood other's hate for people that sell and do what they want with THEIR money.

What alt coins are you jumping into, if any, and why?
Thursday I'll put it back into BTC, then reexamine the market or just play quick trades. Some would say I take a naive approach, which I call the commuters stoppage: regular people have a tendency to buy crypto just before they finish work, then commute home, so the price goes up ever so slightly and then goes down - in that time you can only do a few of trades, but would raise about $150 to $350; however, I've also lost on that method. It's akin to gambling. Interestingly, it's a similar method when doing social media, but in reverse order - people that commute like to use social media on their journeys, so posts get greater traction. 

What hater's need to understand is that it's actually beneficial for all coins that we make announcements like this on their forums, as it allows XRP to gauge sentiment around what they are doing. When I worked in crypto, this was always discussed at directors level AGMs (always on the marketing deck).
Keep XRP just 1000 K
Your sacrifice embodies a level of leadership that few have ever attained.
Incredible bravery displayed
I, too, would have made a lot of money if I knew what the market was going to do before it did.
It's all a gamble, but, I truly believed that late 2023 would have been a good year for XRP and growth was expected across all coins.
Jan 1st 2023 0.33. Jan 1 2024 0.63. In between it hit +90 cents. Was everyone just shit posting about nuffin ever happens in xrp land. You can do 89000 trades at a total cost of 1 xrp on the ledger dex. Start using it. Your bag will multiply.
XRP $2 tomorrow.
More like $593
True nobody knows when, but an educated guess says we'll see it surge end April 2024 ( more law suit stuff)

Then beyond that when ISO 2022 Rollout hits in 2025
Imagine if it 20x tomorrow
Can you though üòâ
That's why you have other coins in your portfolio which will be 10x-50x. So it doesn't matter. 
Xrp is risky imo. I think xrp does max 6x in this bull..  maybe it goes only 3$.. will see ..
Ripple is selling a bunch each month, definetly hurting the price. I'm thinking to sell too. Also hodling from 2017.
The moment you sell it‚Äôs going to moon
Getting tired of this response as well.
Yes, that's what we call sods law - hence leaving 15% of my XRP in the pot.
You are cherry picking dates.  If you bought XRP at .32 six months ago you‚Äôd be up 100%.  Not to mention you just messed up your long-term gains for tax purposes.  All this right before the bull market starts.  Obviously, you can‚Äôt change your decision now‚Ä¶ But I really think you did exactly what they wanted you to.  But I wish you luck with whatever else you bought instead.
I'm English and live outside of the UK (non-dom status), so I don't need to pay tax. I worked for BCH and they paid our salaries in BCH, we were allowed to work from any location - hence leaving.
good 4 u , no one cares
I‚Äôm happy I diversified the last couple years.

XRP has long been my 2nd biggest bag.

Kinda wish I‚Äôd done more with solana but still happy I have more ways to win.

This is why we play.

Plan your trade and trade your plan boys.
Indeed XRP was my 2nd biggest until now, now it's ADA. Should have listened to my buddy who kept on saying: "buy SOL" - I just put $850 in to keep him quiet, wish I put more üòÇü§£üòÇ. Saying that, I stopped listening to people's opinions years ago and have to go by the gut.
Do what you gotta do Studio1st
It might not be the best time to sell majority of your bag, with the bitcoin halving right around the corner, a crypto ETF, resolution of the SEC lawsuit, and Flare F-assets coming to unlock DEFI for XRP all about to act as huge buoys to the market. But hey you do you, nobody has a crystal ball in this place or we would all already be millionaires.
Did you or didn‚Äôt you. Either way you are likely to make the biggest mistake of your life if you chase after BTC
Bro I invested in safemoon... I finally wised up and diversified my portfolio, got some BTC and XRP soon to grab some Solana when I can... XRP will go somewhere
I also bought SFM, not much as the buying process was so blimin annoying. It was good fun whilst it lasted - but I'm sad for those that lost a massive bag. You did a good move - well done.
Same thing if ppl invest apple msft instead of PayPal.. the difference was huge.
80 cents tomorrow
Been thinking of doing the same or at least stop my DCA.
The news is not getting better. I think we all thought we would see partnerships, settlements, AMM passing.. but we get ripple doubling the amount of xrp they sold over the last month
They sold to rebuy in the next major crash. Very possible.
Honestly good for you man. I haven‚Äôt held XRP for years, but it‚Äôs clear it‚Äôs a coin of yesteryear. There‚Äôs so many more promising projects that will net you a greater return on investment. I‚Äôm glad you finally shook off cobwebs and moved on.
I have been holding for over 10 years now with my first batch and it is what it is. I can sell and of course I made profit but at what I paid who cares.
byyeeeee
Thank you man I wanna see people happy
See you at the bus stop when I drive by in my lambo
I mean i think its just a better decision to put your money elsewhere but personally it wouldnt hurt to have a small bag of xrp just for a long term hold in case it ever breaks 62cents
Best decision man, Btc and Algo is the way üëå
Nice. You're going to get some hate from the hard-core fans.

But I agree with your position, I too am on this boat. Tired of this coin and company lagging behind.
I'll be selling more of my bag for other coins.

 Sure xrp will have its time in the sun, but it's always usually short lived. 

Also, there's a good chance we don't see $2 this year, let alone $1. Too much in circulation, not enough momentum.
Totally agree. We all enjoy the affiliation with certain coins we buy and live being part of the community - that's a big part. I have no hate for hard-core fans or bad comments, that's all part of the trip. 

But, at the end of the day - we're investors and move around to suit. Doesn't mean my faith has gone, I just want a better ROI.
If you need money ok but if not I would just leave it, we never know when the switch will happen üòÅ
Sounds like $0.42 guy
Smart move not to sell everything. Hope you put it in projects you have good feelings about. 
I‚Äôm holding on to my XRP, which is almost 50% of my total portfolio because I do believe in it.
I know where you are coming from. I sold 66 percent of my holdings in XRP when the SEC lawsuit was announced and bought bitcoin and ETH with it. I still have a good position in XRP, but I can sleep better at night.
I think that's key: stick with that gut feeling. For some reason many people refuse to invest in BTC, calling it useless; however, it's been the most stable coin that the majority follow its ups and downs. ETH gas fees can get quite high, which affected me when I was trading NFTs - so I have very little in ETH. Hope your spread wins for you buddy.
I have xrp and also btc, ethereum ando others alt... Remember the first years of bitcoin... A few cents... to 1 dollar to 10 to 20 to 200 to 70 again... 12 years later... +$40.000
I know it's crazy. I worked in finance in the early days and mentioned BTC to my colleagues and said, look just put in ¬£250, all told me it's a stupid investment. Fast forward to Dec 2017 collapse, they hoovered around my cubicle informing me that they were right, to which I simply said - but I'm still 3500% up on my initial investment. My friend was given 1000 BTC in the early days, upgraded her laptop, gave her old one to her son - he cleaned the harddrive, and that was that. We never discuss crypto, it's too painful for her.
Chasing those green candles, 6 years and you can't wait abit longer. You deserve everything thats coming for you.
How do you know it's "just a bit longer" and not another 10 years

you don't.
This thing is never going to move till those xrp in escrow are burned.  This is worse than a stable coin
Smart Man, I fucked off xrp a long time ago and very happy I did so! It‚Äôs all hype no action, everyone thinking it‚Äôs sky rocketing may aswell believe the earth is flat lol
Damn - the earth isn't flat üòÇü§£üòÇ
Sounds like you only want to get rich fast and for the majority of people this will never happen. The patient ones are the ones who will settle one day with wealth. No one knows if it happens with xrp oder brc or eth and so on but trying to ‚Äúfast lane‚Äù right now seems not like a good move for me
LOL - I've been investing since 2014 in crypto, hardly concerned about "...get rich fast...". Boredom has struck me with XRP after 6 years, which I would say is being patient and I'm not putting down XRP as I've had tremendous growth since my first investment.
Lol he has been holding six years. That‚Äôs pretty patient. But I do think the value of his XRP will rise if he continues to hold. 

I am thinking of selling as well just so I can pay off my house. Save $500 just off of the interest I‚Äôm paying on the mortgage and I could put that $500 right back into XRP.
Never understood posts like this. I doubt you‚Äôve been holding for six years as investing into Xrp back then and even now has always been *if*/*when* utility kicks in. The case isnt even completely over yet, 2024 is about to be a bull run for the market. And we‚Äôve still not had any major players or institutions enter the market yet. It‚Äôs always been a long term plan. Good luck but people like you no disrespect don‚Äôt deserve life changing wealth. 
If you‚Äôre expectation was Xrp should have given you huge ROI you‚Äôve had chances in 6 years
If you‚Äôre expectation was chasing green candles year to year why would you even be involved in Xrp in the first place. Plenty of shit coins and gamble coins
Mate I bought BTC & LTC when you had to take a photo of yourself, holding a newspaper and ID, sending money through escrow. And back then everyone I knew said that was a stupid investment and it really was IF back then; however, that investment out performed all my stocks and ISA investments by 1000 fold. 

Oh and I've bought plenty of shit coins as well - they're just fun.
Lol. Stuff is doing multiple xs and people like you baghold xrp cause ‚Äûwhen utility kicks in‚Äú.
I did that 3 years ago, no regrets allin btc and it pays.
Why are you here ü•∏ 
Like weirdos who sell xrp come back all the time like a jealous ex
Great job! Now get lost!!
Thank god, bye. I have no idea why people need to make posts like this. It's cool that you sold 85% of your sad bag not adding any useful info, proof, explanations why, just another useless post by a useless "wannabe" crypto trader trying to sound smart.
And yet, you deemed it worthy enough to get upset about and make a complaining reply lol
It's called a forum (community), we can't just bounce around on the positive future of XRP all the time. I could have shared this with one of my family members, but, they would understand what I'm talking about. But then we have delightful people like you - who just wants attention through rudeness. Good for you ü§£üòÇ
The gate is about to open, don‚Äôt compare it to Bitcoin. XRP is better than Bitcoin in many ways.
Ok, the get has been ‚Äúabout to open‚Äù for 4 years now
K, byeee
cool story bro, tell it again.
Nobody cares cry baby
Thank you for caring enough to comment. üòòüòò
I'm just going to keep on with my weekly buys...thanks for letting me buy some of yours
Sell before the bull, very smart. Buy high sell low GG
Seems you just don‚Äôt get it. Some people just won‚Äôt ever understand.
Fuck XRP üòÇ
Selling right before the halving is a disgustingly bad decision, statistically speaking
Well it depends, if he's buying other coins that might have bigger rises in the short term than XRP it could end up being a good decision.
your selling didn't influence the price though... ah wait... didn't check XRP market cap. 

Respect for all the XRP bag holders out there though.
Investing is a bus ride.

You decided to leave a few stops early, and accepted a loss.

What difference would it have made to at least wait until you broke even? XRP isn't on a collision course into the sun. There is no disaster to avert.

If youre using your sale to FOMO into something else, expect this behavior to repeat itself. Expect to lose more.

Edit: reading is fundamental...I may have misread....did you mean you made a profit of $867 per $1000 or that you lost 14%? If the former, disregard my comment, enjoy your 86% APY, and good luck in your next bag!
Ok. Not an airport bye
See you soon
Did he just said no one really know when its gonna raise.....look bro eveyone know is not now or next year it was clear when XRP was confirm NOT A SECURITY also it is clear Ripple plans with XRP so if you use your head a little bit this can raise somewhere in year 2030 maybe sooner......so how old are you 90 that you cant just wait or if you are younger dont you have a job or more things to do and let this XRP stay until big time.......incredible....
XRP is for the new financial system and that system is about to start up so selling you XRP now is like building your custom house and then selling it because the builder took to long. That girls about to say ‚Äútake me ‚Äúand your like ‚Äúno I don‚Äôt like sex anymore‚Äù.
Damn bro your already a millionaire
Not just yet but I definitely will be. Multi millionaire
You expected something by now yet the court case isn't truly finished until at least a few months? Strange. I wouldn't expect anything until xrp has absolute clarity.
I expected the market to grow due to BTC halving (possibly April); however, as others rose in these early  stages - XRP settled. BTC genuinely acts as a magnet for alt coins and some storm ahead.
Imagine selling before a court case settlement
Lol i wouldn‚Äôt be selling anything till 2027 to 2030
How inspiring. Jeeez..
Good decision. XRP is among the worst crypto. I dropped 100% of my bag at 70 cents a few months back and never felt happier.
It takes years for the average joe to realize the gamble is already built into crypto and to consolidate to BTC/ETH.

Might as well burn your money if you invest in anything other then the above.
Congratulations ü•Ç
üòè
Just wait until 2025. Just wait it out man.
what happens then?
Xrp is a laggard. It‚Äôs known
Swap to Algo

It‚Äôs better tech
Thank you.
Well, XRP should've risen in price by now but there are reasons why it wouldn't have. The play seems to be that institutions are going to sell the news on a BTC ETF and then buy altcoins like XRP Which would make chasing pumps at the beginning of a bull run one of the worst moves somebody could make but chasing pumps is usually not a good idea anyway
Use the stock market. It‚Äôs a better investment tool.
I've been adjusting my holding targets. Sold 5% and bought some kaspa at 3¬¢. Pretty happy with that. It's just a bit difficult finding coins I'm willing to sit with long term. This year I plan to exit at least 25%. Fairly certain that this next bull run is going to be the last truly volatile and profitable cycle. Assuming that with the larger institutions investing the market will start to stabilize to a point where we'd be happy to see 10% gains in a quarter.
Understandable. Holding XRP is exhausting. Everything moons while we look like a stable coin. At least it‚Äôs not Luna or some other scam. That‚Äôs what I tell myself.
Time capitulation. It is a real thing.
XRP is usually one of the last crypto to pump. I'm holding and accumulating more. Especially when you look at the macro TA on a chart, looks like a bullish reversal in a couple of months to me.
pump incoming!
XRP is up 78% from a year ago?

Agreed ROI has been poor, but I don't see the point selling now. What will you rotate into, everything else has pumped you'll be buying the local top
If you would have played the market when it hit 91c de risked and had patience it dropped almost to 50c again flat. Six years into xrp and not playing those giant green wicks is crazy to me.
I feel you man. Kind regards LTC.
Probably a bad time to sell but if you‚Äôre putting the funds into other coins it‚Äôs a solid move. So much potential in other stuff. I‚Äôm starting to look at my ltc bag the same way lol
You‚Äôll kick yourself in the ass when you get wrecked for chasing coins that are pumping.
PAMP IT
üçºüçºüçºüçºüçºüçºüçºüçºüê£
I am ü§èüèΩ close to doing the same with 50+% gain in the 3 years I‚Äôve held. But it‚Äôs easy to forget I even have it at times.
It all depends on your investment style, I would never recommend anyone to sell or what to buy. It's really down to personal preference and there's nothing wrong with holding either. For me BTC is a mothership that feeds my other investments.
Dumped all my XRP at the beginning of the lawsuit.  Moved to other coins.  Tripled my money.  Came back and bought more XRP than I had to begin with and still have a bunch of other investments now.  Use common sense.
Fool
just set the money there and leave it be. it will eventually take off. unless of course you needed the money then i get it, but man go do other things with your life stop watching XRP so closely. i put the crytpo news aside for a while just working normal job along side it taking it easy. no reason to rush anything
All the ISO coins have been idle. 

Algo, XLM, xrp...

Yes that money could be put somewhere else for quick gains, I think a healthy portfolio should consist of both.

To have no xrp at all is a mistake Imo.
Wow, haven't realized I been holding for so long, still up thought bought it at 20cent, but wow 6 years.......but I understand kinda want to close out of all my positions and be done
You're really selling when the chart looks the way it does, and selling to chase other pumping tokens (ones that have already gone up)?

Do people even like money?

Get a back bone ü•∏
My first was in 2017 and holding. To average my XRP to 0.4 cents, I purchased XRP 30 times in last few years. I can feel your pain. I am fortunate to 
diversify my portfolio with BTC, ETH, ADA etc..
I will recommend you to pick 5-6 coins and diversify it.
k, good luck.
Congrats op you‚Äôve finally taken the red pill. I took it when XRP dropped back to .50 and never looked back. Still can‚Äôt change my stupid username though‚Ä¶.
As long as you're okay with your decision despite whatever happens.
Slaughter the weak little lamb. Thank you!
Any half brain understands ripple needs th settlement paid to close out the lawsuit,
I have come to the point that xrp is the invisible investment. Maybe it will go up. Maybe it will break the bank. I truly believe that xrp will hit a dollar and then someone, but the questions is when and how long. Now my focus is setting up my son's future and not mine. If I get to be apart of the success it's a bonus. I believe my time has passed to be financially successful, and now death is right behind me. This is my reality and not a sob story. Some generations have to make the sacrifice for other generations to succeed in wealth and happiness.
We're so happy to see you go.
this fool invested in stable coins, HAH i think USDC has 4% apy at least.
I did the same thing!! Been putting it into TIA, and riding the high and lows!!!
Cry about it
Lmao sell the rest 
Attention seeker
I can understand why you'd change your risk position 

I'm not adding to xrp, only holding in a physical wallet. I'm waiting until the entire SEC fiasco is over with. I'll hold for $2, unless they plan to burn escrow. 

Bitcoin is certainly the more stable investment choice. That and the s&p500

However, I think 2024-2026 is going to be a very rough ride
Bye Felicia
I don't even remember my wallet password. I should recheck the coins
Thanks for the cheap coins. I will be rolling in my Ferrari later.
Well done sir you are now free to invest in the PLETHORA of other cryptographic currencies that will GREATLY out perform xrp
In my mind, XRP is a very long-term hold. Legacy financial players are just now getting into BTC with the ETF; we're still early. XRP's strength will come with utility, and that utility will be realized once money starts flowing on-chain, real-world assets begin getting tokenized, and value begins to move cross-chain among everyone, similar to emails today. I feel like XRP is a 10-20+ year hold. I hope sooner, but I'd say it's a buy-it-and-forget-it asset. I almost assume my XRP bag is nonexistent lol. I feel XRPs use case is so early in the game that we won't see the benefits until digital assets and digital property become household, and the XRPL has more projects built on top of it, aside from just Ripple.
And just felt the need to tell everyone ! Ok.......üòÇüòÇüòÜ
Cool story bro
Glad to have got my slice of the pie at .30 c. I was expecting more of a reaction reflected in price after success with the SEC case.
Thank god i bought XRP recently üòÇ couldn‚Äôt imagine 6 years of stress. Hope all goes well for you other coins tho.
Yes moon soon
U gonna regret mark my words
Xrp is a reasonable investment compared to other altcoins, but you can't compare that with Btc. Btc is a different beast; its decentralisation, immutability and large supporter base means that it is always the king of crypto.
Adios! Bad move IMHO!!!
All good man. I had to sell last year around the crypto nose dive.. I was in super super low too‚Ä¶ just got to do what you got to do
You sold your tulips! ??
More for me
4 years holding strong
its going to 10 USD an you sell???
That's funny, I just bought $65 more today. 

Maybe I bought some of the coins you sold?
Atleast hold until 2030.
Good choice, homie üëå
I can't force myself to do that.
I hope this is a joke. Please.
How can one expect any decent price appreciation when there is sooo much supply?
Good, I sold half and bought other coin. Xrp is just a max 3x-6x coin..so boring to hold it.. if it even rises anywhere üôÑ
But never all in one coin and sometimes it's good to leave a tiny moonbag ü§û
Good move. The watching the last few years has given me high blood pressure. I may follow you. I waited for the case to end and the exchange relistings and they came. Yet I‚Äôm still super in the red. I could‚Äôve invested in something else but I held this for all that time. I think I made a mistake
Just sell mate. Xrp isn‚Äôt going to do fuck all. You‚Äôre right - if it was going to do something, it would have done it by now.
Can I ask what compelled you to announce this here? And then continue to respond to comments?

Im not having a go im just curious.

If you don't reply, good luck in your future endeavours!
I personally believe you made a mistake, but I also kinda understand. It's a long game and it isn't for everyone.
"never looked back"

Yet here you are...looking in...
Nice one lol üòÇ
Beat me to it

I have no idea why XRP hodlers are so confident. They continue to fud other coins but hardly get any gains  for years now. I don't blame someone for investing in XRP but why are all of them seemingly hodling only XRP and convinced it will be the next thing? At least diversify a bit! I even knew 2 people irl who both decided to buy crypto and bought XRP as BTC rose and are still convinced of their investment ü§°
You actually rarely see xrp holders fudding other coins. 

And you are here ...
Yeah I hold some XRP because I think in potential it can be significant. But I‚Äôm very diversified, XRP only represents a small portion of my crypto holdings. Bummer to see it hasn‚Äôt grown much yet, I‚Äôve honestly been more bullish on Chainlink for a while. We‚Äôll see if the Evernode airdrop is worth anything
That dominance chart is about to flip üôÉ‚ÜïÔ∏èüôÇ.

relax its a running gag
XRP is a running GAG.

Love how these circle jerk reddit subs just auto downvote everyone that has differing opinions.
Stable coin investing now that is like paying for watching paint dry
5 percent on Coinbase. It‚Äôs like a cd except you can take it when u want no penalty.
It's not as bad as losing 5k to madmeerkat on cronos haha(a project that stole millions from scrub finance, mmo optimizer, madmeerkat finance cheaters
Amen to Luna! Ughhh
Mine consists of the top 10 primarily. The one I made the most in though was $RUNE a few years back. And I have a huge MiamiCoin that is worthless lol. Then I have some ‚Äúfun money‚Äù that I throw at meme coins based on their names alone and don‚Äôt stay in them too long. XRP could blow up, but it could also never hit ATH again.
That's really the only way to invest in meme coins, whether people hate them - their short lived hype always makes me smile.
Not financial advice but coming into what‚Äôs expecting to be a bull market in the next year or two. Surely the play is to just hold your Alts that your expecting movement on and move your stable coins to tokens you want more exposure to 

Throw it back to stable coins in 2025 when your taking some profits from it all
You reckon XRP goes there?
Exactly! I think OP forgets we actually moved first before every other coin, then wants a secondary move along with all the others, patience is a virtue.
Comparatively * to other major Coins ü™ô.  High risk should be high reward, right?
I guess that is where we differ in opinion on how XRP should perform, especially since the SEC case still lives on. I do not get the same high risk feeling or rush with XRP like I do with my other Alt coins, many of whom the dev team is faceless, the utility and use case is questionable, information is sparse and very niche to a few sources, and every week I wonder if this is the week to shoot way up or shoot way down, but that‚Äôs what I dig about Ripple, a large enterprise software company with 15 offices around the world and 1,200+ employees, many of whom are on X and are active, they are not going to shut down overnight, and they are actively working with XRP with their RippleNet software. 

Since Ripple leverages XRP with their software and they are a multi-billion dollar company, with Ripple I bet on a big dog, that is still the underdog, but I don‚Äôt ever feel I am standing on shaky ground where I am gonna get rugged. As long as I can turn on the financial news on a number of cable networks any day of the week and see the XRP ticker price, yeah I am not about to begin to lose sleep or faith in the coin until that stops.
Exactly. If you are diversified, you hold only a % of your investments in crypto. It could be rug pulled tomorrow, which there are only too many examples of. So the advice of "Don't play with money you are not prepared to lose" is very apt.

Compare 87% gain to keeping it in the bank or a HSA. You'd be looking at 5%. I am guessing OPs entry point was not from one year ago, maybe around today's price and has cut their losses?
Exactly. That 34c is probably the one and only time I‚Äôll catch any bottom of any coin lol. Too bad I just threw 50$ in but that‚Äôs a positive ROi so I‚Äôm not even mad
Hey OP you should have swapped your XRP for SOL when it was at $8 should've could've would've
I wonder if there‚Äôs a 8$ SOL guy
Ahahaha you so funnnnaaay
aNy DaY nOw!!?!
Law of diminishing returns. Btc isn‚Äôt going to make 10k% ROI. Each time it hits a new ATH it‚Äôs always a smaller % ROI from the previous. Xrp hasn‚Äôt had an ATH in 2021 and still is due a significant jump. Basic maths will tell you the % ROI will be less than that of 2017/18
A few investing rules you may want to adopt:

1. If you are FOMOing in and out of projects, you are gambling, not investing. Go to Las Vegas, you have better odds there.
2. Your beliefs have no impact on the price.
3. Expectations of growth are not guaranteed.
4. Virtually no project influences the price of another; however, market forces may move the space as a whole.

So if you adopt those, you'll realize that everything you just said is faulty logic at best.

You can just scroll past you know that right?
Gotcha. It just seems like weird timing.  Things are just revving up right now.
Not sure if basket any Ada but to each their own.
Yep got that too

In the bear market I decided to put 5k into several of the top 10‚Äôs just to see what would pop in the next bull run

Had a good feeling on SOL but that could also just be that confirmation bias now that it‚Äôs rocking

ADA was my first alt after xrp but started buying it really high so followed it all the way down bc mama didn‚Äôt raise no bitch (that‚Äôs what I tell myself when the panic sets in)
Xrp is the only coin where key events like the case we could actually say have a positive impact.
That‚Äôs separate to the fact Xrp along with the market is seeing a  bull run this year.
And saying what if another 10 years is lazy you could use that same logic w so many coins.
What if a new law/reg came in and 90% of coins went to 0
6 years ago puts you right around ath date or just before.
And you think since then ripple or Xrp has achieved its goal and failed or do you think it‚Äôs still super early yet in the aim? Cause if it‚Äôs the latter you‚Äôre too emotional to be holding for ‚Äú6 years‚Äù and selling now. I mean you‚Äôre DCA should be sub 30c minimum. You shouldn‚Äôt even be worried about selling it‚Äôs like the people who wanted to sell Xrp pre summary judgement why?
Not at all, I think XRP has a long way to go and It's early - maybe too early. I'm just bored of it sitting there like a doormat in my portfolio, and don't feel it'll enjoy the rise that's expected from BTC halving, due to the case still spinning around. Look, I'm not bitching on XRP and still kept a small percentage in, just feel better ROI opportunities can be at play with the present market.
This is true as well
Not just yet but soon and I‚Äôll be a multi millionaire. XRP is not the only game I got going.
It hits .75
üòÇü§£ this really made me laugh üòÇü§£
The next bullrun will increase the price. Much higher then what it is now. Better to be patient
Much higher? By how much are you speculating?
your life must be boring and pathetic as fuck if you think watching a crypto is entertainment
I hope you like Lamborghinis

that doesn't justify putting all your eggs in one lame basket.
You can get 5% on cash though. Why involve the risk of stable coins?

Fr xrp an Shib are in my plays too haha 

May everyone be doing great!
About 4 years ago I was days into getting interested in crypto. Looked at SOL at .05 I think it was and thought oh that‚Äôs cheap. I should buy some. I would have easily put 1K in. I didn‚Äôt. My son brings that up once in a while when he wants to hurt me.
Hi. I loaded up at $8.92.
I bought a bunch at$8 but I also swapped an eth for Sol when it was at $170 so I'm basically up about 100% at the moment on Sol.
Got in and got out of Ada caught a spike never looked back not a fan of the ‚Äúowner‚Äù one bit. Best of luck bud
Right? I wouldn't be surprised. And you'll still have someone say "wait until 2026". Or "this is a 5 - 10 year investment". 

Tired of hearing that. I've been supporting and holding this coin since 2016/2017. I'm done. It's underperformed since 2018.
I don‚Äôt know mate. If I could see the future I wouldnt be typing this rn would i?
Still
XRP and JapanHey, has anybody seen this?:

https://www.forbes.com/advisor/money-transfer/currency-converter/xrp-jpy/It seems like more than that though. It seems like the rails are already up and running in Japan. Did you scroll all the way down?
I think Japan has been working with XRP / Ripple for a long time now SBI is an investor in Ripple if I am not mistaken they also used Ripple's ODL services.
That's interesting. 

1.) I didn't know jpy was so inflated. 

2.) it's cool to see a crypto being available to fiat.
It's just a rate calculator, doesn't do anything but estimate conversion value
Then what are those links at the bottom?
I just found an article about it. Here is an excerpt:

‚ÄúThe APAC region is exploding with growth and opportunities for RippleNet in response to progressive crypto regulation and innovative companies, such as SBI Remit, looking to lead in the crypto space. Asia Pacific is one of the fastest growing regions for Ripple with transactions growing 130% year-over-year. In this next phase of the partnership, SBI Remit will connect with other established partners on RippleNet and utilize XRP to accelerate their high performance payments business.‚Äù

Apparently, transactions from Japan to the Philippines have already been happening since 2021. If XRP is already being utilized, then, why hasn‚Äôt the price moved to reflect the demand?
It's polite to link sources.

Well if you have JPY and you want to get to PHP and your money transmitter is going through XRP what happens?

Bank Japan takes your yen and buys xrp. Bank Japan sends xrp to Bank Philippines. Bank Philippines sells xrp for PHP. Bank Philippines gives PHP to recipient.

What's the price pressure on XRP? 1 buy = 1 sell, increases in buy/sell orders is equal from transaction.
Price action is so disappointing üòû  I have serious concerns it won't go higher than last bullrun high.
https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210727006246/en/Ripple-Launches-On-Demand-Liquidity-with-SBI-Remit-to-Accelerate-and-Grow-Cross-Border-Payments-from-Japan
If you change the currencies and click calculate it'll give you the same list of "popular trading pairs" with whatever you selected no matter how bizarro the pairs actually are.
I set up an account with Xe just to see what would happen. These were my delivery choices: 

Deliver to bank
Cash pickup or
‚ÄúMobile wallet‚Äù

Why does it have the exchange rate and then a big ‚ÄúSend Money‚Äù button underneath it?

What would XRP have to do with any of these transactions?
Here‚Äôs a source: 

https://bitcoinist.com/japanese-financial-giant-ripple-xrp-service/

It‚Äôs already happening. XRP is being used as a bridge currency between two fiats. And here I thought we were waiting for CBDCs to be implemented.
Thanks. We're slowly ramping up liquidity. Aka the ability to move more money without moving the price.
XRP were also used by Money Gram before the lawsuit.
Here is the release from 2021 from where the quotes he shared, and also in the article he linked to, originated from.

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210727006246/en/Ripple-Launches-On-Demand-Liquidity-with-SBI-Remit-to-Accelerate-and-Grow-Cross-Border-Payments-from-Japan
Sure, Xe is a money transmitter. [Here's a page that may answer some of your questions](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/money-transfer/xe-review/) They appear to have some relation to Ria which has been reported/rumored to be partnered with Ripple.

But if you examine the terms of payment it doesn't look like they're flexing any advantages of using XRP.

Take funding: credit card is fastest but your cc company will charge you cash advance fees (commonly 3-5% of amount) plus for non EU customers Xe will also charge a cash advance fee. Obviously this is an expensive method of payment. The other option is bank funding which can take 4 days. 

Take spread: the exchange rate you see is the mid-market rate, not what you'll actually get when you try to send money. Xe will take a margin.

Okay, so were are the benefits of using XRP? They're not there because they're not using it (yet) or they are unbelievably not passing the benefits on to customers and outcompeting everyone else in the space.

Frankly, the advantages of Xe vs other money transmitters are the number of recipient countries and that cash pickup is more available. For the oddball currencies you're looking at, there is likely nil or very little liquidity in the XRP / *that* pair. For forex markets even today outside of the most heavily traded pairs, exchanges jump through common currencies. So instead of of the listed pair you're actually trading into USD and then from USD into the other currency.

The vision is for XRP to make it so any currency is at most one hop away from any other, instead of having huge numbers of illiquid pairs. Existing money transmitters have the network but once they upgrade to xrpl rails with deep, liquid XRP pools the ripplenet software will show final payment amounts in real time - before sending - settlement can be in minutes and fees can be much lower.
