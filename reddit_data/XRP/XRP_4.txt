Tin foil hat time. News flash - It's all scripted folks.My conspiracy theory:

Bitcoin was created and the wider crypto market was started by the very same group that created the fractional reserve banking system on Jekyll Island\* back in the day. It all came from the 2008 financial crisis right? It's not like they hadn't been looking for a solution years before. It's all scripted folks.

XRP is currently #6 and has a market cap of 33.5 Billion Dollars. There are individual players on this planet who could literally buy every XRP in existence.  The crypto market is far from organic, it's carefully controlled and manipulated by the powers that be. Easily.

Satoshi is the NWO and the NWO is Satoshi.

I would expand on my theory but unfortunately I'm very, very drunk.

Merry Christmas Everybody!

*\*read "The creature from Jekyll Island" by G. Edward Griffin*Sounds plausible
Satoshi is anonymous for a reason that all I'm sayin
Satoshi Nakomoto literally translates to central intelligence;
SHA 256 was created by the NSA and at the time of bitcoins creation pretty much only used by the NSA;
Schwartz worked for the NSA and if you run a stylography analysis on the Bitcoin white paper vs Schwartz‚Äôs distributed computing patent it comes back with a greater than .95 r squared / 95 percent plus confidence of identical authorship whereas if you compare any of the other suspects known writings it comes back with less than 50 percent every time; multiple people claimed to have met Satoshi at UC Berkeley right after bitcoins release‚Ä¶guess who hangs out in Berkeley a lot (you guessed it); I can keep going but long story short I will always believe that Schwartz was either Satoshi or the leader of the group that was Satoshi.
So what is Satoshi?
I believe Satoshi Nakomoto was an I-RO-Ha cypher and that if you solve the cypher you have the genesis block. Why do I say that? Because the black box / nsa has long had a huge boner for early 20th century Japanese cryptology.
Now this is my kind of information
I heard it as this

Sa -samsung
Toshi ‚Äîtoshiba

Nako - nakamichi
Moto - motorola
Interesting. I've always thought it was likely a group. I suspect, Yonatan Sompolinsky, taking part in the creation of Bitcoin. 

Yonatan Sompolinsky -> Onny Satosi Nakamoto

Yonatan is from Israel. If you pronounce ‚ÄòOnny‚Äô in English it will sound like ‚ÄòI am‚Äô in hebrew.  Coincidence?
So the name Satoshi Nakomoto may be some sort of key (or key to a key) to the 1 million crypto in Satoshis wallet?
Tell me more please
Len Sassaman is Satoshi, not Schwartz.

Only crypto post I‚Äôve ever read and enjoyed
Resonated greatly with me also.
Why are so many people acting like money isn‚Äôt fake to begin with?! 

It‚Äôs man made!

We print the US dollar and have nothing to back it!

There‚Äôs no difference between the US dollar going to zero and anything else. 

The US dollar is literally a shit coin. SMH ü§¶
I'm just gonna leave [this](https://piped.video/watch?v=AOk3wBuQNcE) here.

Jekyll Island starts at 01:47:55
I will never believe they don‚Äôt know who Satoshi is. All the big banks and basically the world are throwing money at something that they don‚Äôt know who created it? Yeah right. It is most definitely all planned out. We are just squirrels in their world.
Let all the rich and powerful buy all the Bitcoin. Let them fight over it. As for the rest of us 99% of the world don't waste your money, it's not going to make you rich at this point unless you have a fuck ton of money already. There's better coins that do what Bitcoin does and does it better, plus more. That's the thing about crypto, if the 1% rich and powerful own it all, and the rest of the world says fuck that, this is no different than the way the current money system operates, and invested instead in a coin like, Kaspa, for example, where everyone can get in on a good price, on a coin that BTC wishes it could be, suddenly the great shift begins, and BTC suddenly becomes worthless. If one group owns it all, and wants to hold it like is currently taking place for the low price of 30 to 40k a coin, it's only worth it to the ones that hold it, especially if everyone has no interest in investing in a coin that only keeps the rich in the green on their investments. They'll have to sell it eventually regardless, for it to be of value, thats the beauty of a total supply. Just my thoughts on it. If people would consider this, it would be quite the rug pull for all those greedy fucks. Merry Christmas. May your God be with you. #kaspa ‚ô•Ô∏è
Yes.

"they" are Satoshi.
The ‚Äúfour Satoshis‚Äù are Arthur Britto, David Schwartz, Hal Finney and Clif High. You‚Äôre on the money!
You want conspiracies? Look into how MIT proved tin foil hats actually AMPLIFY the radio wave frequencies reserved for US government communications. Either it's a hilarious coincidence or a misinformation campaign to ensure the most dangerous people are easiest to access. 

https://hacks.mit.edu/Hacks/by\_year/2005/tinfoil\_hats/
For sure, we used to use aluminum foil to fix our T.V. reception back in the day.
Merry Xmas üéÅ
The only problem with your description is that you are not sharing the drinks with the rest of us xrp devotees wondering what the actual fuck is going on. Other than that; your reasoning is sound.

Cheers üçª and merry fucking christmas
Has anyone felt that crypto could actually be here to bankrupt us, what if there was backdoor access not visible on chain that granted them access to our Bitcoin, or the ability to freeze assets? If we can believe in hidden technology far more advanced then what we have now why couldn‚Äôt that be a possibility?
OMG‚Ä¶.poor ole Michael Saylor and Larry Fink‚Ä¶.lol.
It's absolutely a possibility. central bank digital currency, that's why sec is being a pain in the ass and now more banks and institutions are getting involved. If we allow crypto to be centralized it's game over, they'll control all money.
It's why many of us are torn.   


XRP to the moon, yes...   
CBDCs, no...  


If we have one we probably have to take the other.
You got me.
understandable, have a nice day
Beat it Gensler!   


jk
I thought NWO are Scott Hall, Kevin Nash and Hulk Hogan?
This sounds suspiciously like a ploy to read your book. Which I might just jolly well do!
It's an old book. G. Edward Griffin is a legend!
Many of us in XRP are in it for that reason, just along for the ride.
Ofcourse it is.
Coming to conclusion that are not really basic and fitting the narrative shouldn‚Äôt be automatically considered ‚Äòtin foil hat‚Äô‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs just the reality sometimes
Interesting theory & I have read the creature from Jekyll island & I highly recommend you read the rise and fall of the third reich & Imperial cruise , Lords of finance as they lay out the playbook of TPTB very well indeed !
Add LORDS OF CREATION to your reading list.
"what can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence." - Hitchen's Razor

The good news is that even Satoshi's coin hoard (1.1M coins on various Bitcoin forks) etc doesn't matter much today in the big scheme of things.

Unlike the internet, which we know was created out of DARPA efforts, there's not been any real evidence that some shadowy intelligence services created Bitcoin.

We do know that certain cryptographers at the NSA researched electronic minting systems like it before its time. (can't be bothered to dig up the link now, but it's well known so you should easily find it)

I think there is circumstantial evidence that Bitcoin was either created by some one or a group as an effort outside these circles, or by maybe by someone in the know who wanted to liberate this type of technology (maybe based on some precursor research of central bank digital currency).

We know for a fact that the intelligence community hasn't used the cryptographic artifacts of Satoshi against Bitcoin so far. No repeat messages signed by Satoshi's original PGP key, no further reveal of the inner secrets of the genesis block, no movement of Satoshi coins or authentic signatures made from their keys to shake market confidence e.g. when Bitcoin Cash forked (this would have been a great opportunity to strengthen control in the small blocker BTC side by e.g. signing a message like "what these big blockers are doing is completely misguided".

I don't believe the intelligence services have the goods, or they would not have needed to resort to much more expensive measures to keep Bitcoin under control.

If this is the case, then it also means they for sure did not create Bitcoin.

I also think Satoshi is never going to reveal themselves, unfortunately it might mean that they were quickly uncovered and taken into custody - or worse. But I think they took or will take their secrets with them into the hereafter.
Love that book! Have read more than once! Full of massive truth bombs! üôèüëçüëç
Oh, it's scripted all right.  

It's a fucking comedy, and we're the joke.
Were all actors on the world stage.
Meh. My take. Crypto was created by the CIA to fund their black ops because they were drawing too much heat selling drugs to minorities.
Forgot to add the US is the largest holder of bitcoin
I mean.. Dan Pena said he knows who created Bitcoin and that it would likely hit zero if we found out who created it..
Ah, If I had an XRP for every time someone told me they know who created Bitcoin...
They‚Äôre still alive after 1911?
Great book by the way. Read A World without cancer. Just as good
It's why I said the same "group" and not the same people. Basically, the elites.
I‚Äôve been thinking about this since 2018. My theory is basically this as well‚Ä¶Satoshi was created by the secret societies and three letter agencies to rollout the new wave of financial control. BRICS and CBDC are the real intention. I‚Äôm just mimicking my portfolio to copy the central banks around the world‚Ä¶can‚Äôt go wrong with that strategy imo. That way if my portfolio goes down, hopefully the banks have too üòÇ
It‚Äôs plausible. 1) Create a new electronic investment asset. 2) Show that ‚Äúcommon people‚Äù can make fortunes with it. 3) Let the scheme unfold, selling the assets and drawing in gobs of money. 4) Suffer world-wide ‚ÄúAct of God‚Äù event that fries electronics. 5) Count your money.
I‚Äôve always thought that, relying way too much on electricity/electronics. 1 major event away from Stone Age (short or long term).
Yep, you got it. It‚Äôs amazing what people are willing to buy into when being influenced by an echo chamber from YouTube, Facebook, X, and redit. People have lost all ability to think and are constantly just looking for someone to tell them what to do.
What is going on lately with the crazy shit posts? I haven't seen this type of activity in years. Don't get me wrong, I prefer this over the usual "is it a good time to buy right now or will it dip lower"?
XRP hasn't been running up a lot like other cryptos have lately. People are getting worked up.
What has this sub turned into
How was it before I turned up? Sorry if I ruined the moon party...
I didn't have time to read the book, but [this](https://www.youtube.com/live/dr1e4t0gAL0?si=lQZPaagg8cZyDFuv) youtube summary is amazing.
Hahaha I appreciate your train of thought but this is the most pessimistic outlook on bitcoin I‚Äôve ever heard! 

ü§£ just tell me you lost money. üí¥
Bitcoin is the test,the Spot ETF will be used to pump the price to new all time high and the contents of Satoshi Nakamotos Bitcoin will be liquidated and put into XRP causing bitcoin to crash and XRP to become the new Top crypto currency.
https://youtube.com/shorts/J_RfqojWJ8k?si=NtHNa7oa95Wg5BsB
That‚Äôs great and all but how does this affect a Lebrons legacy?
Please tell me when moon
I saw a video a while back explaining how the NSA created Bitcoin, wouldn‚Äôt surprise me
Satoshi remains anonymous for a reason - I‚Äôm no scholar, but imo, BTC will one day rule the world, and, he/they don‚Äôt want the wheeling, dealing, politics, and BSing that goes with it. What they‚Äôve created is beyond, ‚Äúthe Pyramids - the Great Wall, Machu Picchu‚Äù, etc.
When I first heard about Bitcoin and the possibility of mining coins on my PC, I cynically wondered what my PC might *really* be doing. Maybe it would be a part of some hidden network, set on some malevolent deed or other.

I wonder now if that was indeed the case. Nothing happens by accident.
GREETINGS
The nsa filed the patent for bitcoin blockchain. According to youtube.
I have been thinking for a while that it‚Äôs very possible the gov created crypto
Who exactly are ‚Äòthe powers that be‚Äô?
Read the book that OP suggested and you‚Äôll find out!
3 things happened during the timeframe of the 2008 Elections..

- Recession(problem)

- First Black President(distraction)

- Bitcoin went live(solution)
BRO I TOLD YOU BTC WAS INVENTED BY THE GOVT TO END CASH AND TO TRACK ALL PAYMENTS FOREVER ON THE BLOCKCHAIN 

Fkn genius federal reserve you son of a bitch I‚Äôm in!!!!
Homeland Security knows who the Satoshis are:

Skip to 44:00 mins. There were 4 people.
It would make for one hell of a movie üçø 

I just think Hal was extremely forward thinking in his ambiguity ü§îüòÖ
I also believe this
There‚Äôs evidence that the government may have started it starting with the military. They had a book about how to mint a coin back in the 80s
Yep, your drunk
The NWO (or more accurately, WEF) created something (P2P Cash, mostly in BCH and XMR now though) that renders governments, banks and the NWO itself obsolete?
I‚Äôm way too far in the rabbit hole & I wished I never looked. I found the true game plan for Xrp. Yes, you‚Äôll be rich buy your mansion, lambo,.. blah blah blah. Joel Katz did work for nsa & a patent was filed during the 1980‚Äôs for a distributed ledger tech. Everything we are witnessing in the markets is methodically planned, decades ahead. New World Order, the digital revolution is here. It‚Äôll create an entire new economy, just like the Industrial Revolution. Here‚Äôs where it gets deep‚Ä¶ Yes, aliens are here to help us. Joel Katz is here with the alien technology to further the human race. We are so self centered- believing that we are the only species in the universe. We are far behind in extraterrestrial technology & the space race. Nwo, they are separating the strong from the weak. Lambs vs lions. Nwo, Xrp.. Who will make it? Humans will forever be enslaved if we aren‚Äôt able to leave this planet. We can‚Äôt even travel our own solar system. Humans have been alive long before this planet & Earth isn‚Äôt going to last, we are burning it up. We are using up all of our natural resources for energy, burning up our planet. We are still not able to harness this planet‚Äôs own energy, so far behind. What currency do you think we will use when we are visiting an exotic planet? Debit card? Credit card? Cash? Xrp is the galaxies‚Äô universal form of currency. Our financial decisions during these times can literally make or break our coming generations. We are living a historical moment in human history. Godspeed loved ones. Peace peace peace.
Is this Call? Lol
I agree with you, we should be thankful that we can see what the majority of the worlds population can't see and use it to our advantage.
Yes, scripted written by Bullshitto Ajitnomotto.
The fact that the SEC gives  Bitcoin a free pass when the creator of it is unknown tells ya the creator ain‚Äôt unknown
Very smart conclusion
NSA
They give it a pass because it was fair launched and there wasn‚Äôt any ICO therefor no expectation of financial return inherently makes it not a security
True !
That‚Äôs my theory.
Either satoshi nakomoto is the seed and the key is missing or is the key and the seed is missing.
My guess is that the embedded ‚Äúbanks fail‚Äù statement in the genesis block is a clue of some sort.
If anyone solves it please tip me 2 Bitcoin lol
Reading right now, on chapter 23, MIND IS FUCKING BLOWN ü§Ø
Damned elites. Where is 117 when you need him?
He‚Äôs giving the Covenant back their bomb

Research paper (pdf) on testing and evaluation of AMM on XRP ledgerHol up‚Ä¶

Is this? 

Can it be??

Something of value?!?

On the XRP sub?!?!
Damn high quality post
Wow
Will your XRP be insured when using the AMM?
