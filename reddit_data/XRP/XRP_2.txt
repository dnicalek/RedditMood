 ⠀X is back. Let's spread XRP
Yes. LFG!
XRP saved my Christmas.Hello everyone, today I want to share my history of how XRP saved my Christmas.

I been saving some XRP and BTC from time to time since October 2022  not significant amounts, but I was saving like 10-15 USD per month, some months I couldn't afford it, mostly because my monthly salary it's around 200 USD here in Argentina.

I managed to save 147 USD in XRP until today.

3 days ago I was coming back home after work and when I was around 10 steps from the door I got assaulted by 3 men and they managed to get me in to the house and they robbed most of the valuable stuff in the house (PS4, phone, notebook, my Christmas bonus, all the PS4 games, the tv and some other small things)
After this I had to do something because the money I needed to buy everything for the Christmas day was gone I had to buy again lots of things, but I remembered I had those XRP saved, so I changed it from XRP to USDT to Argentina pesos (134.000$) and now I won't have the best Christmas so far with a lot of gifts and details but we will have a dinner and peace here in my house.


Having this kind of technology and ways to protect some money saved my Christmas this time.

Hope everyone gets a very good Christmas and new year.Really sorry about your experience 
Glad you had some xrp
Thanks! Things like this happens, I was really sad/mad at first time but this was a second chance
Sounds like a bunch lies
Because it is.

"To share my history" 

What history? You "got robbed" 3 days ago.
I wish more people have the same mindset you have to turn a negative experience to positive
Tan feliz seguro votaste a Milei.
Obvio bobis
... and Christmas gifts are the priority?
Not this time, I literally had no money to even buy the Christmas dinner. Now at least I can have some pasta with my family.
Not everybody speaks perfect English
English isn't my native language either and to be honest "3 days ago" is in the past, therefore is history. 

If it's really true, I do feel sorry for OP.
XRP is one of the coins that will give people generational wealth if played correctly.... all u have to do is wait couple of generations firstBs!
Yea for my grandkids’ grandkids
Just get to 10K coins and leave it in your ledger and forget about it. Than start to invest other items.
Does anyone really believe this?
Other than diamond hands, no
This is a borderline shit post. There’s nothing to see here besides an OP hopped up on hopium. No forecasting, projections, information to decipher, just trying to get some Reddit karma and kickoff a circlejerk
Generational wealth needs to be a banned term in 2024.
Not a chance 😞
When this lawsuit over for real? They can't even give a date. How unorganized.
Unorganized by design (SEC)
🤣😂🤣 finally, someone speaks the truth about XRP. I wonder if the XRP Loyalists ever think to themselves....so, I've tied up all my money in this project and it never does a damn thing. Hmmm, I wonder how much I've missed out on having my money tied up?

Yeah, you guys could have placed it into let's say, Solana!!! You'd be up alot at this point instead of what the hell yall keep waiting on. 

Know what my XRP plan is considering the numbers some of yall come up with. My plan is hold like 5 or 10, which I've already forgotten about. Then when it hits that unbelievable number I cash put
If you've tied up all your eggs in one basket with XRP ..You're definitely not the sharpest tool in the shed. I've got a reasonable amount on XRP and also in many more... some are doing extremely while some others not so much. It's called diversification folks . Good luck
Or you know there are smart investors who have holdings in a broad number of projects, and even ones outside of crypto and tradfi.
Everyone doesn’t invest for instant gratification.. let’s see how this ages in the next 5-10 years. 

The majority of folks who chase “solana” or “bonk”  , etc generally get hurt financially so it’s generally a rule of thumb not to follow the crowd and trade off of emotion. The insiders are the ones who truly get rich.
I'm guna take the penalty hit and cash out my 401k, pull out my savings, and put it all into XRP and Shiba Inu 😂😂
" Don't worry, honey. I don't know why you're so upset. Shiba and XRP are going to the moon!"
I’ve been holding forever and it feels like it will never go up like others…
XRP is looking like its just about to explode to the upside
played correctly hey?🤔
Forget the old times dude
😴😴😴😴😴
I finally dumped my small stack. Better off in a bank CD.
Thank you for your sacrifice.
XRP is just about to make a huge upside move like you never seen before 👩‍🚀🚀
Broken record at this point. I have a good amount and I’d love nothing more than this but the way it’s looking shit coins will outperform this all day every day
Depends where you bought in at.. if you bought below the .2 mark youre sitting pretty good rn
If you bought in around .4-.6 im sure waiting sucks but it takes time
I'd say we're almost halfway there!!
5 generations here. Still holding. 💀
Wait a Generation my ass
 I am a staunch believer in xrp have a decent size bag  but it has been a disappointment to put it mildly.
 I started buying at the high and cost averaging down.
 What blows my mind is sec messed with them specifically to let other coins specifically ethereum flourish.
 This and btc are the only coins with clarity. 
Xrp probably has the most utility of almost any coin and yet it just sits here while other coins go up 300 % 
On a whole lot of just speculation. 
 The world makes no sense ...lol
You mean just hold until it’s in triple digits I presume
By selling and putting what you have left in a memecoin on a another chain?
sweet, so only have to wait a couple generations!! Keep winning
🤣sounds like you’ll miss out big time
If you hold anything less than 150k coins it's pointless. You not gonna get rich off $5k-$50k with xrp. But if u drop $70-100k on it right now, im sure you'll have $1,000,000 in 12-18 months.
You cant group solana and bonk together. Bonk is just a shit coin on the solana network 🤣
I dunno, "DogWifHat" coin is way up today and I'm SURE that if I put my money in now I'll be a winner! /s
Yeah, the amount of times I’ve read that before. 🙄 I’ll look at it in 3 months from now.
It’s true, I DID miss out on this week’s 3-cent gain.
I’ve been thinking of doing the same. It’s stagnant at this point.
Gee, never heard that before!
Lol. I can only laugh at you.
XRP will reach 1 dollar again whether it wins or notEven if we no win the case. The hype before that will put it at 1 dollar. Thats my gut feeling.Aristotle over here coming through with this invaluable advice…and at no cost?

P.S. - You forgot to include the 🚀 emoji. Nobody’s going to believe your well thought out, concise, investment thesis w/o the 🚀 emoji.
I don't subscribe to using that emoji. That belongs to another group that buys manipulated stocks. The Wallstreet Mafia doesn't control crypto.......yet.
Thanks I feel ready to invest with this deep dive.
np
We already won. Am I missing something?
Didn't win yet still in the process. That is what the hold up is. When it's all over then you will know for sure because then it's gonna be brought up like 29 cent 🍔
You know the second win.
Believe hbar to hit 1dollar before xrp does 😴
I’ll still just keep my bag for when the 100s of banks that already are on XRP and already have ripple tech integrated get their proper clearance bc well I don’t need it that’s why I invested it 🚀
Lol okay, now I am ready to go all-in
Thank you for the update
Great. Why the fuck should any of us care about an internet strangers uninformed "gut feeling"
If you look at any TA, it's likely that it will hit $1.2. it's never certain, but it would take some sort of terrible news for it to happen.
rising tides and whatnot.....
Ripple has to co ordinate all the central banks and wait for them to get the stuff in order. Its not an over night process but when they are ready, it will be over night xrp goes to the moon.
$589 or die
Clearly, you have constipation💪
All those xs amazing that's not even 2x man but yeah it will damn what a sitter of a crypto
Well that's more realistic than 10000000$ per coin. lol
I’m up $150 smackers WooHoo
I don't give a shit about your feelings..

I just want a fucking end date for the case so we can Carry on with life and I can sell my God damn XRP
Man, the hopium dealers are cutting the shit so hard, it's more baby laxative than moonborghinis.

That number is so reasonable, you may have just said 70 cents.

Move over, I'll take a rail.
Sure it will, it's going to follow inflation.
Been waiting so long I don’t even check pricing at this point. One day I’ll wake up and be surprised or the same ol same ol continues. Nothing to see here.
We did win and the appeal was already shot down. This has to be a joke or I’m missing the punch like here.
We did win and it's in the settlement phase of proceedings to sort the fine for the couple of sales deemed securities.  So you are correct.

(I know it was more than a couple)
No bro the headlines just all hopium and bs. Court is waaaaay more complicated than that. Secondary sales are not institutional sales. So they won the battle for the little guys but now they have to win the big kid battle. That's what this last part is. So the big kids can play without anybody messing with them. This will be how we the little guy benefits
🤷‍♂️
This is what I thought too. Pretty sure flex Detroit is wrong.
The SEC is gonna drag this out as long as possible yes it got legitimacy as a commodity over a security but that’s basically it so far in court it’s ongoing.
No he is not wrong. Yes so far xrp has won and it has been deemed not a utility and the sec appeal got rejected however the case for institutional sales is going to court and straight after that finishes the sec has said they will def appeal the status of xrp again as they will be allowed to appeal once rest of this current court case is over. People here struggle to understand why price action isnt going up much atm.
Your both half right.

Techically the "match" is not over.
But xrp already scored the points they cared about, now it's just for extra points.

They won the status of the coin not being a security 
Now they are just arguing how much of a fine they have to pay for the sales that were deemed as securities
No the sec have backed off the 2 CEO's and dropped that case. It was just a partial win though infront of the judge. 

There is still a grey area to what they did, they didn't do something right or its borderline and that is what is happening now. 

Evidence gathering is happening now and the court date is already set for April.

Even though sec have stopped and the appeal was denied, it is now a court matter to see whether or not any wrong doing has been done.
👍
The SEC is doing this because Congress is trying to find a way to control Crypto. They are doing this to stall rulings until Congress finds a way to get a Bill in place. This will open the door for the Wallstreet Mafia to get their dirty hands on the Crypto market to manipulate.
Exactly. They just shot down coinbases suit to get more rules/clarity on other cryptos established w/o even telling them anything other than to request a review of the case.
