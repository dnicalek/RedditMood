 ‚†ÄSold everything yesterdayAm I going to be the 62c guy?Thank you for your sacrifice
Ya welcome
You are called ‚Äúsellers‚Äù 
We are ‚ÄúBuyers‚Äù
I would‚Äôve given you a PS5 + two large pizzas
Haha, it was enough for one smaller pizza and the rest he paid tax as Biden & Son LLC like it such tips
XRP gonna hit $5 tomorrow now
Utter ‚Äúthank you lerryberry‚Äù as you open the door of your lambo
It just did
Is this just talk or should I put my life savings into xrp right now?
I hope it works out for you . I will be holding my puny amount of only 10000 xrp til it goes to zero or up to thousands . Worth a gamble .
This. I don‚Äôt even think about it. One day I‚Äôll either be rich from this alone or it‚Äôll be worth $0.
Humble brag. 10k aint puny
I‚Äôm with you. I‚Äôve made my decision, I have my bag stored, and I‚Äôm seeing where this all goes, good or bad.
I definitely wouldn‚Äôt hold till the thousands
I'm waiting until late march, if there's no sniff of settlement with SEC by then I'm getting out and switching to BTC in time for the halving. I'd rather take a little bit of something than another however many years of nothing.
well hopefully by March 
let‚Äôs hope for the end of this year 
into Jan. 
there should be price action.
BTC usually dumps into halving just fyi
Once any ETF is approved, likely all will be. They can't just pick and choose arbitrary BS. I need to look at the facts in each one, but Blackrock will either tank the full bitcoin market or make it so impossible to buy that even 0.0001 will be out of reach by the average person.
Nah it's only 48c guy legacy. 

You're just in the collective group of selling under a dollar. Nothing special about you for that.
Where is he ?
Did you buy a pizza with the money?
Just garlic bread
Sad history
So, you sold everything just to make this post and ask if you're going to be the 62 cents guy?
‚úÖ
$589 or nothing bro
In at 11cents  this duffle bag isn't going anywhere  I did get a nice Ram Big Horn out of smome of the bag 2 years ago. Hold that xrp yawl  there's a lot going on building to the flip of the switch
Nice, I sold at 19c and I'm waiting for $3 before I buy it back!
I‚Äôm a stick around myself, might even buy some more
I had a .48 avg. took my XRP and sold .62-64 and went right into SOL and TIA a couple weeks ago. Lowered my XRP amount from 15k to ~9500 Xrp. Best decision I ever made.
Same I sold about half my bag and I‚Äôve been in and out of other alts making some actual money. Life has been really good outside of XRP. Nothing against it but this just isn‚Äôt where the price action is right now.
Lucky gamble.
Biggest bull flag ever formed in history going back to 2018. I‚Äôve been buying for 3 years and your selling ü•≥
i thought about it aswell but mama didnt raise a quitter
You big dummy lol
Dumb ass
If you sold SOL, AVAX, INJ, or LINK, I would understand.  But, XRP always moons late in the cycle.
He sold so little. The market is not reflecting it.
I'll answer your question with a question; Who cares?
I do, why did you sell?
I don‚Äôt think a settlement will happen this bull run. There‚Äôs a regulatory war on Crypto and it‚Äôs going to last this whole bull run
Do whatever you want.
It‚Äôll be back to .61-.62 tomorrow. You should know this by now. Nothing significant is going to happen short term.
üòÇüòÇ
Damn‚Ä¶ Where did you buy your crystal ball?  üòÇ
That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs going up. I sold 1/3 just before it pumped the last time. I was ü§¢
Yes you will, have you not done any research on the coin? Let me help you,The answer is no. You sell the coin days before banks and cross borders settlement is implemented. But I'm sure your research has shown you made the right decision.
Just 2 more weeks right.
You will regret this ten years from now lol. Go out and double your money in the stock market and buy the same amount again. We'll be here. If it breaks two dollars jump back in.
I‚Äôm still holding praying for a moon shot
Enjoy UBI bro
You're an idiot.
Holy shit we're about to pump
Good on you for making a decisive move. Personally, I think the time to sell is long gone. This is the time to accumulate. Of course, if personal circumstances allow.
M2 money supply is dropping like a rock. No new dollar bills physically printed since 2017. 5 U.S. states and several countries are making 24k foil dollar bills and silver foil bills! Talks of  Treasury dollars that are backed by gold/silver to overtake Federal Reserve notes circa 2025. If XRP is gold backed and XLM is backed by silver then there‚Äôs a good possibility that there will be a new set of wealthy individuals!
23 million and counting are the new millionaires according to the debt clock NESARA/GESARA
 ü§£ Man oh man the ones that actually after all this time sell will hang themselves when this does start pumping.  To each their own, I‚Äôll continue DCA till she blows up. Gotta happen eventually and even if it doesn‚Äôt make it over ATH‚Äôs it‚Äôll still be an awesome return at $3.5. I‚Äôll keep at least few thousand for when it does go higher.
I bought more :)
we are ready for blast off
I don't have much but intend to hold mine to moon or to zero. It would be great to see it moon, after holding for 3 years but if I goes to zero, it won't be the end of world. Just a lesson learned. Best of luck to us all
I sold aswell. Ill buy back once it hits .30 lmao
RNDR going to $8 ????
Let me guess, going to go fomo into the local top for Solana? Then panic sell solana on the fall and fomo back into xrp at $1.10.  

Crypto and investing isnt for everyone. This isnt your thing and thats ok.
Thank you for your cervix
Paper hands
I‚Äôm about to sell too I think. Pay off my house
Xrp waiting for settlement in a few months it won't move till lawsuit is completed
it shouldn‚Äôt when a major part of the lawsuit was that it was not a security 
n the day that happens maybe exchanges relisted 
price action should still be happening.
No‚Ä¶.you are gonna be the ‚ÄúI thought I was funny guy, but I wasn‚Äôt‚Äù
Maybe, maybe not, my nuts are on the table
Can I just ask why you sell right before an almost certain prospect of a bull run?

Even if it dips a bit before it pops, surely it will be worth waiting to see if it's more by the end of 2024 and the end of the bull run?
I just don‚Äôt see a settlement happening this bull run. Also we‚Äôve had years of partnerships and announcements athat didn‚Äôt do didely squat
You are the clever guy. XRP is like the son you want to make it to the team yet fails to do so regardless of how much support and encouragement you give him.

It's always 65 cents then dumps to 60 cents. You want your son to make it but he ain't delivering the home runs.
Thanks , now we pumping , why you took so long !!!!!!!!!!!!!
Now, take that money and actually use it to male money instead of hanging on to those insane pipe dreams. You'll look back and be thankful
I bet the people who sold their Bitcoins for a penny disagree with you.
I did some because of presents. But am gonna put it back
Patience y‚Äôall
More for me to buy and sell next year
Who cares man? Bye bye
Sell that shit bro xrp us going nowhere
You are like the Jesus of the coins. Thanks for your sacrifice
Clever man
I got in at 74 cents. Could someone please wake me up when it hits 73?  I'm ready to dump my 10,000 XRP.
I‚Äôm more curious what did you buy with the money. I guess you are right. Xrp has historically perform terribly in a bull run
People buy and sell everyday. You thought it was Gona drop so sold like everyone else who sold yesterday
I wonder if btc ppl look back and think that ü§î‚Ä¶..imagine turning 100k into 12.5 billion @ .40 cent‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs almost disgusting to think about.
 Most likely!
yes
God bless you
Well well well..
No regerts
lol
Thanks bro its starting to move!
Dammit
No wonder it‚Äôs goin up
Derp.
How much xrp you had ?
Did you invest into another coin or cash out?
Why did you sell everything?
why sell all? take out investment plus a profit and let the rest go boldly where no XRP has gone before.

sell fractional
Thank you sir!
I'm very sorry to hear that , xrp was in a weird situation,
But u shouldn't have sold after they got licensed Irland and more talk of eft in hong Kong

I understand the SEC screwed us
Idk things feel volatile right now. It is either going to 30 cents or to 1 dollar in a few weeks and there is no in between.
Hope 25 dollers by end of next month
Ok. Let‚Äôs all remember this original post in a year and looked at it to see if that was a good decision. In the meantime I will hold what I have and buy more when I can. Wish you all prosperous 2024.
But the crypto bull market is upon us
No worries. It will drop so you can buy up at a cheaper price increasing your position. It's actually more likely to drop to 49cents before reaching up to $1 again.
THE APPLE FALLS "EXACTLY" 62 FEET AWAY FROM THE TREE....   THANK YOU FOR YOUR SACRIFICE!!!!!
Thats not wise. Xrp is a great crypto and hasnt even really gotten started yet. Im 100% convinced Ripple is keeping the price low until it has all the contracts it wants, and all their partnerships have their bags full. 

XRP is longterm. 

Itll be worth $1000s someday, and youll regret you sold. If you need to, too pay bills, I get it. But if its not hurting you at least hold some.
Ditto and bought OXT
Lol 352 dollars one day ü§£
Ummmm no! Please know what your talking about before spewing nonsense.
Where to buy xrp?
All these fucking idiots not realising what they're holding lol
Where‚Äôs the best place to buy xrp?
!remind 1 year
Really? The bull market is probably starting in 2024.
I am doing the same thing. I don't wanna miss this bullrun as I missed the last one.

The price performance sucks lately. And lately is a few years back.

I feel you.
Someone has to‚Ä¶ for the harvest
Everyone has a choice what to buy or sell, if and when to hold. There is no ‚Äòuniversal right or wrong‚Äô‚Ä¶it is simply YOUR financial journey, based on the research and information you have collected. 

My research of XRP says buy and hold as much as I can. Financial markets are changing. New standards are being established. New protocols are taking place, being created, and tested as we speak. 

I am sorry you sold‚Ä¶you will be missed!
How many XRP did you sell?
Lol 
I mean there was a guy who bought pizza with 20k bitcoin
Hopefully you need the money for something 
Otherwise it‚Äôs literally gonna be one of the biggest mistakes in your life. If BTC could reach 1T market cap, watch xrp
I know you are probably joking, but this is not a terrible price.

I am in the green for now ... so I am going to ride it a little longer and see if we get a some kind of settlement.
65 cents - 69 cents. Then it's down.
mate why you sell up?
Couldn‚Äôt wait 2 more weeks bro
Just bought more!üí™
Toilet-Paper hands I call it  üßª  ü§≤
You must be silly with bull run coming
üôè
I'll call mine the Lamberryghini for you
My nose is burning from the Sprite I just spat out of it from reading this.

(I'll call mine Lerryberryghini)
üèÜ
This wins the thread.
Your sacrifice wont be in vain lerryberry
Sadly it will be
I want a Porsche 911 turbo s tho
Ill call my Ferrari Lerry Berrari for you
That would be a damn nice name for a butler tho üòÇ
Spoken like a true moonlambo.
Moon lambo was making xrp videos before it was even invented lol
Me to. Ride or die. Already detached from the $ emotionally. Waiting for utility. Might pull some out for a new car at some point, but plan on driving my current whip till it disintegrates or I get filthy.
why couldn't it continue to hover between 50c and $2?
Got in at 30cents , only 3k worth . Holding strong . Was tempted to sell when it popped to a dollar . But didnt want to miss the possibility of being in on the next bitcoin . Fingers crossed i made the right choice.
Next bitcoin, store of value?
you might be onto something...
See, I want to design an algorithm and setup an anonymous node like that. However, that wouldn't fly these days. Governments all want a piece of it. My contingency on it would be that it can never become an ETF. Private consumers only.
Nearly dead, in a ditch somewhere after a 2 week bath salts bender.
They couldn't afford that!
I saw him yesterday by the dumpster behind Wendy's.
Your sacrifice shall not be in vein.
I still like Xrp but jeez lately I have been treating it like USDC. Lol
This means the majority of crypto will be affected. Selling your XRP was, in my opinion, not very smart.
Even if a bitcoin spot etf is approved? There's all this news about it being approved frist quarter of 2024 and as soon as first week of January. Honestly tho, this makes me believe it's meant to focus all attention on bitcoin while the court case is settled and XRP moons. Wishful thinking, I  know.
It doesn‚Äôt matter if the settlement happens this year or not, xrp is still the only crypto with legal clarity, the only thing in courts right now is whether institutions who bought were a security or not, and even if those were securities they would just be fined and any sales in the future to institutions would need to be bought the same way retail does, it doesn‚Äôt change a whole lot, although I think the sec can still make an appeal, do I have this right? If so xrp still has a leg up as far as clarity against all the other cryptos. People are like it‚Äôs not moving though! It had a 100 percent move from 30 cents to 60 cents not that long ago in a bear market, give it some time to coil for its next move, chasing pumps is a sure way to lose out.
I'm not babysitting you, look it up.
election year man, ALOT of things just happen to get done in election years and then that party uses it as a "look what I did" and everyone forgets the previous 3 years of nothing.

This is a great year to hold all crypto as election years are always strong years for the markets.    
Either way, good luck to you and happy holidays!
XRP is not Bitcoin and will never see those type of gains.
lol what are you even doing here?
Im mocking the latest analysis report released overnight ü§¶ü§¶
Same thing happened to me reading your sprite dilamma , but with ice coffee
Same thing happened to me but with my beer
Right, it was dollar store deodorant
Invest 16,000‚Ç¨ in XRP as a financial independence gamble?Hey, I have been able to realize a sum of ‚Ç¨ 16,000 as profit through a few investments in other projects.

I am currently looking for a project in which I can invest the ‚Ç¨16,000 with the prospect of financial freedom, even if there is only a 1% chance, without risking my entire investment.

Do you think an investment should XRP fall back to ‚Ç¨0.40 makes sense with this project?
40,000 XRP tokens would be quite a lot.

A total loss would be planned for me anyway, but since I only got the sum through investments, that wouldn't really bother me, you just take the risk üòÖIf you're going to make that kind of bet, XRP is a good one to do it on.
Yes, most stable projects have maybe a 10x potential, which of course would also be a lot of money, but we are talking more about a bet with which you could build a nice house, buy a dream car (BMW M4 G82) and not have to worry about fixed costs, and we are talking more about a 30-40x potential.
Yeah I'd yeet into XRP. Wait a few years.
Did that 5 years ago. Still waiting
Key words, ‚Äúa few years‚Äù, OP please take note, know what you hold! We‚Äôre all in this for the long haul
Never put all of your eggs in the same basket. Diversify homie
This. 

Nothing wrong with putting a chunk into XRP, but there is no such thing as a ‚Äúsure thing.‚Äù
In the past, I have only ever bought into individual projects at what I consider to be very good prices when the market was bleeding heavily.
That would also be the plan for the next pullback
Completely agree.
I would never put my eggs all in one basket, but if I was too, xrp is definitely a good choice and one of the safest bets being it‚Äôs the only one with legal clarity. If it were me I‚Äôd diversify take profits along the way and put your profits back into xrp.
Personally, I‚Äôd allocated it across 2-3 quality projects you believe in. I would never yeet everything into just one.
Apart from XRP, I don't know of any fundamentally solid projects in which you are unlikely to lose your entire stake, but which on the other hand have a 30-60x potential
You‚Äôre a future multi millionaire my guy
Why?
You wont have to wait a few years buddy..this alt market is about to pop..xrp is the way
Too many people are waiting for a drop. I don‚Äôt think there will be one. That‚Äôs how bull markets start, everyone is waiting for another drop and when they realize it doesn‚Äôt happen, fomo begins
10k in btc 6k in xrp
Either 50/50 HBAR, XRP
or
70/30 HBAR, XRP
This
You‚Äôd be much safer and have higher returns with btc
Put your money somewhere else.
There is no investing into XRP as it's a gamble
XRP will be dropping lower. Wait until then before getting in.
1% is a long shot. If you bet on Red or Black at a roulette table you‚Äôll still have like a 48% chance of doubling your money.
And a 52% chance of losing it all immediately. With XRP you‚Äôll likely not lose much, and you‚Äôll have plenty of time to cut your losses.
As long as you see it as a gamble it's a solid bet.
Do it. I think you can mostly get it at $0.6
Remember that was statistically proved that 95% traders will end in loss BUT 82% gamblers will end at loss. So better be a gambler üóø
Diversify as others have mentioned. I‚Äôve got about 40% of my investments in XRP, but also 40% in BTC. The other 20% is divided over Alts that I believe in. None of my current investments are needed back‚Ä¶ at all. So I‚Äôm happy to wait 10 years if necessary.
Xrp is a stable coin so its risk free! But you‚Äôll also have no gains in 5 years
I would break it into 3 to 5 bets. I'm 5 years deep in xrp but quite disillusioned. Thinking it will be a miracle if we hit its ATH and I'm OUT.
I invest based on price to BTC. If you look at the BTC/XRP chart it‚Äôs as low as it‚Äôs been for a long while. And it usually bounces off the current price level. I also yeeted in with 40k xrp a couple of weeks ago.

I‚Äôll jinx it with this, but I feel pretty confident it‚Äôll result in a profit against BTC in the coming year based on historical data.
Joke's on you.

When btc goes down, xrp goes down.

When btc goes up, xrp stays where it is.

btc gets further from xrp year to year....just like the moon from us. An apt analogy, actually.
No fucking the way
Just go buy bitcoin
I look at a post like this . I just wish I had this kinda cash last bull run. I waltzed in, put ¬£100 down on q random Crypto, and turned it into ¬£16k

I'll likely never do this again :(
I would put 8k in XRP and 8k in XDC.
r/XRP is a respected corridor of investment.

Put it all into Beanie Babies. Buy the dip.
Yes, but never put all your money on one horse
If it were me and i could afford to lose the money. I would of done this already.
Oh no wait a minute, I already have! üòä
No. Never put your eggs in one basket. Diversify your investments. Hold physical silver and gold etc.
Try to diversify your portfolio
I wouldn't call it investment since you just want to gamble, why don't you just throw a coin.
Diversify. I chose 5 projects that I like instead of investing just in one
the amount of delusion in here is astounding
>30% drop..?
I did the same, 4 years ago.  I'm still up on the trade, but I've wasted 4yrs in a cult of bozos who study bear riddles and think lizard people are trying to screw them personally.  

It takes 4yrs to get a degree.  Be careful.
i wouldnt buy xrp if you intend to make that much money
If u want freedom better not to do that trade. If you okay if you lose all of it then go for it! But 100% it wont make u financialy free! Thats gambling not trading or investing !
You have access to the same information the rest of us do. Yolo is more about you than this investment.

Are you a patient, zen investor who‚Äôs convicted in the technology and company or a shitbird trader who‚Äôs going to watch the chart with bated breath every second of every day and cry on reddit when his 16k is down to 5k one day due to‚Ä¶ reasons? Will you be just sad if that 16k disappears or financially destitute?

Regardless, IMO would be wiser in such a volatile / speculative class to pick a period of time (given the best data you can muster) over which you DCA a percentage of that 16k like clockwork to smooth out your entry. (Accounting for exchange fees) The other percentage, DCA into more stable investments to diversify - possibly projects that run contra to XRP.

I‚Äôm not a financial advisor though so this strategy is only if you hate losing money more than gambling.
Put them on green
Good, keep it up.
Keep yeeting
Ahahaha me too.
I‚Äôd say invest what you‚Äôre okay losing 100% of; if you really wanna play it safe, do 75% of your 16,000 in XRP, and the rest in large company or growth ETFs for security. VOO or VGT are good options. This isn‚Äôt financial advice.
Bitcoin and eth probably aren‚Äôt going away this cycle, other good projects in my opinion that have stood the test of time would be things like chainlink which IS one of the only few that have actual utility that‚Äôs actually being used, cardano avax and solana are probably some other good bets, though solana does have some drama around it. Just put a smaller portion into your riskier assets. 

Edit: I said stood the test of time but solana and avax are fairly new.
Recently realized profits on Chainlink, Polkadot, XRP, and Algo.
XRP is currently the only project that could become interesting again in terms of price.
I wouldn't buy Chainlink for less than ‚Ç¨9, Polkadot for less than ‚Ç¨4 and Algorand for less than ‚Ç¨0.09.
I would buy XRP again for less than ‚Ç¨0.40, which I think is much more realistic than the prices mentioned for the other projects.
In the long term, none of the projects mentioned probably has the same potential as XRP, at least in terms of the hypothesis üòÖ
Bigbear ai
He's thinking that $16,000 in xrp is gonna go up enough to get you to millionaire status. I hope he's right
40k xrp for sure can make you a millionaire.
At only $25 per xrp‚Ä¶
Once it runs up, who knows where it will go.
Why is the joke on me? The price has already gone up since I bought it. It‚Äôs currently at 0.00001493

Over the past 3 years it‚Äôs bounced from .000013 to .00003 3 times.

You comment is factually incorrect.
Also I wouldn‚Äôt bet that xrp will see 40 cents again right when things are about to heat up, I don‚Äôt even think it will touch 40‚Äôon our way back down into the bear market.
I think there will be a very bit correction in the next weeks.
To much hype, to much dumb money and to much commercials out there.
Market is overheating and most of the time thats the time when the drop comes üòÖ
Well everyone has there own investment plans, if you ONLY buy at the bottom of the bear market your for sure gonna win out, but you could easily still buy chainlink solana avax and cardano and still see wild gains, this bull run isn‚Äôt nearly over if we consider past bull run length with other bull runs, I typically lump sum at the bottom and then dca everything I can as close to the top as possible then cash out and repeat. Or at least that‚Äôs my plan this run, last run I held till the very bottom, not gonna do that again üòÖ
My strategy so far has always been to pick very solid projects with good fundamentals, then set a very low price range where I'm prepared to invest my budget and then get in with 100% of the set budget and see where it stands after more than 12 months and sell if there are significant profits.
That's how I arrived at the ‚Ç¨16,000.
But now I'm looking for a project where I can invest my entire capital for the next 2-6 years and where I have the potential to fulfill my dreams without gambling like in a casino
I‚Äôm not saying there won‚Äôt be a drop, but from what I‚Äôve noticed when there is a dip, it seems like xrp dips the least, also pumps the least as far as recent times go, I just don‚Äôt think xrp will dip that far, maybe 55 cents or 50.
xrp stuck in trust wallethey guys

a friend of mine has his XRP on trust wallet - he left it there for years and hasn't touched trust wallet in a long time

a few days ago he tried to move it from trustwallet to another wallet but none of the transactions go through, they all get stuck

he has the 10 xrp (a couple of thousand actually) but he can't send anywhere. any suggestions?Maybe , he‚Äôs XRP is trough binance , he probably has to switch to the ORIGINAL XRP coin to be able to move it
im assuming if he withdrew from binance via BNB network, then just send back to binance
how can he switch it now?
Export the private key. Import the private key into Xumm (now called Xaman wallet).
This is true üëç  you can also try importing key into metamask. Or maybe reinstall trust wallet. I personally use trust wallet.
And after this make another safe account in XUMM and move the XRP to the new account!  
Just to be sure nobody knows your secret.
You can‚Äôt send the 10. They will always remain locked.
Again
Whats the logo for the token look like? At least the smart chain xrp has an orange octagon in the lower right of it.

If you have access to Binance exchange for your country, your probably just doing what most said and  sending back to it and hopefully being able to choose the xrp blockchain to push it out to again.

Good luck
10 XRP is the fee trust wallet holds, so that you can see XRP price moves, When looking at XRP on trust wallet it will ask you for 10 XRP to activate price updates, Hope this helps.
Yeah if that's what happened, he needs some bnb for gas.
Try sending it to this wallet

>rw2ciyaNshpHe7bCHo4bRWq6pqqynnWKQg

Funny if you're not serious. 

Otherwise you're an asshole.
This is how I did it , I swapped my fake XRP (BNB) to BTC token , than BTC token to the original BTC and from there to the original XRP
Keep in mind the market is pumping and fees are high, there could also be a better way to.. good luck üçÄ
Or you could just deposit the wrapped token on binance and withdraw it on native XRPL I don't get why you would swap it for btc and pay extra in exchange fees?
OP says there should be at least 1000xrp in that account they hold in the trust wallet.
