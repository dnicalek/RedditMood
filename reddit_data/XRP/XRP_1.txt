 ‚†ÄFlipped by SOL, gotta love XRP
Stagnant as usual. Time to move more from the xrp bag to other coins.

Probably won't see a decent bump until April
Good morning!
Hello guys
How do you revoke a trustline on XRP Toolkit?A couple years back I created a trustline with XRP Toolkit.  I forgot what the reason was for.  I think it was to claim a drop of some coin.  I honestly can't remember.

I would like to revoke and close or whatever it is called, the trustline.   The reason being that I see a lot of people getting their wallets drained on Metamask etc.  

I honestly don't know how trustlines work or understand it, so I would like to know if I can close /disable/revoke a trustline.  Since its something I do not understand, I rather do this.  Suggestions?1. Metamask is for Ethereum, so, not applicable here.

2. A simple google search reveals that the xrp toolkit has a "manage trustlines" feature. Have you explored this? Are you saying you have trustlines on xrp toolkit trusting something else? Or are you saying you have a trustline from your hot or cold wallet to the xrp toolkit?

3. Trustlines are just a preauthenticated relationship, which grants an amount of trust and/or permissions to other wallets and systems and Dapps.

4. It is a smart thing to disestablish trustlines you are no longer using. So, good on you for remaining vigilant.
All  you have to do is go to the assets in the account tab and you will see the trustlines you have in place.  You can edit or delete them from there.
If you have a Xumm wallet it is very easy to
Uphold vault for xrp?Anybody try the uphold vault for xrp? It is better than a ledger? What are the benefits?If you can't trust yourself to understand the technology and handle it well, than fine. There's risks either way.
I use it...
No issues..
Seems like a good idea if managing hardware wallets is not your game. I will still stay on hardware and self custody but it‚Äôs not for everyone for sure. The future is likely things like vault for mass adoption.

Completely different wallets.

Ledger is a cold offline wallet
Uphold is an online hot wallet

I do not recommended you use uphold vault as they store your seed phrase.

Xumm wallet, dcent and exodus are far better online hot wallets.
