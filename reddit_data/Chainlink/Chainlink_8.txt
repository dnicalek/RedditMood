CHAINLINK GENESIS BLOCK OR FIRST BLOCK 

# ðŸ“·

Hello, i ve been trying to find the CHAINLINK s genesis block or first block in the explorer but without sucess, can someone give me a hand, please? Thank you in advance.I think the better question here isâ€¦ Why do you need it?
Iâ€™ve seen this being asked in multiple different forums I think this is some sort of bot or spam question meant to confuse people , or perhaps part of a larger social engineering program
Could it be this?
