Can someone smarter than me explain Chainlink’s future after ethereum’s dencun upgrade?I noticed that the dencun upgrade according to this article:

https://blockworks.co/news/ethereum-improvement-proposals-2024

Says that the upgrade will make it so that ethereum no longer needs external oracles.

Is this true? Or is this oversimplification and or maybe only talking about one specific function an oracle can do is no longer needed.My interpretation is The data they are talking about is the state of validators, other Beacon Chain metrics that needed an Oracle to update and develop smart contracts on mainnet that need this data, not something usually Chainlink is chosen for I guess like it’s not market data it’s data about the state of a separate chain and making it more accessible
Chainlink is so much more than oracles now but this would not affect its oracle business anyways.
